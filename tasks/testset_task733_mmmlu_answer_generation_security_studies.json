A threat to coerce a state to give up part of its territory would count as coercive diplomacy, as long as that threat proactively initiates action before reactive diplomacy is taken. (B)Coercive diplomacy constitutes the threats of limited force to induce adversary's incentive to comply with the coercer's demands. It is an influence strategy that is intended to obtain compliance: the use of force to defeat an opponent first does not count. It leaves an element of choice with the target to comply, or to continue. (C)Military force, or the threat of military force, utilises fear to achieve strategic objectives. Coercive diplomacy is differentiated from this approach, because it does not use fear as a tool for coercing an adversary. (D)Coercive diplomacy is employed to use force but to limit its effects on the international community. Coercive diplomacy is an aggressive strategy that is intended to obtain compliance through defeat. It does not leave an element of choice with the target, the target either being forced to comply or engage in conflict. It seeks to control by imposing compliance by removing any opportunity for negotiation or concession.

(B)Children and their mothers are not active subjects in warfare and are best considered as subjects in the private sphere. (C)Children are most often innocent bystanders in war and are best used as signifiers of peace. (D)Children have political subjecthood that is missed when they are considered as passive victims of warfare. ", "output": "D"}, {"input": "In order to become securitized, a threat must be presented in which of these ways?\n(A)As an existential threat that requires immediate and extraordinary action, posing a threat to the survival of the state or to societal security. (B)As requiring immediate and extraordinary action by the state, threatening the survival of a referent object and therefore warranting the use of measures not normally employed in the political realm. (C)As an urgent threat to the survival of the referent object, so serious that it legitimises the employment of extraordinary action in response. (D)As an urgent threat to the survival of the audience that requires extraordinary or emergency measures. ", "output": "C"}, {"input": "How can we best describe the relationship between the state-centric approach and the concept of human security?\n(A)There are such wide divisions within the human security framework regarding the nature of threats and referent objects that no widely applicable comparisons between state-centric approaches and human security can be drawn. (B)By adopting the framework of human security, the limitations of the realist state-centric approach become evident. Whilst human security defines the referent object as the person or population, state-centric approaches prioritise the security of the state, de-prioritizing the pursuit of human security. (C)The state-centric approach to security is a faction of human security, usually defined within the broad school of human security. By being state-centric this approach prioritises the individual as the referent object in security studies. (D)Both the state-centric and human-centric approaches to security are mutually exclusive and offer a sufficient analytic framework with which to understand the international security system. It is therefore the role of security analysts to determine which of these substantial concepts is correct, and which should be discarded. ", "output": "B"}, {"input": "What are the frameworks of analysis within which terrorism has been considered (as of 2020)?\n(A)Competition between larger nations has resulted in some countries actively supporting terrorist groups to undermine the strength of rival states. Terrorist networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor states and are conceptualised as being like state actors, to be dealt with using military force. (B)Globalization has enabled the internationalization of terrorist activities by opening up their operational space, although coordination is still managed from a geographical base. This suggests that terrorist groups are nationally structured which means that terrorism cannot be considered in terms of a war to be defeated militarily without having serious implications on the indigenous population. (C)Terrorism can be viewed as a problem to be resolved by military means (war on terrorism), by normal police techniques (terrorism as crime), or as a medical problem with underlying causes and symptoms (terrorism as disease). (D)Terrorism is viewed as a criminal problem. The criminalization of terrorism has two important implications. Firstly, it suggests that terrorism can be eradicated - terrorists can be caught and brought to trial by normal judicial proceedings thereby removing the threat from society - and secondly, it suggests that preventative crime techniques are applicable to prevent its development.

(B)Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact. (C)The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.

(B)Military security is a central concern within international relations and dominates the scholarship. Within international relations, strategic studies form a subset of academic interest, within which security studies feature occasionally. (C)Strategic studies are best conceptualized as a subset of international relations, and within strategic studies, military security is one of the dominant concerns. Security studies are a subset of strategic studies. (D)Military security is the central concern of strategic studies; and strategic studies are a subset of security studies.

(B)HM is interested in how changes in particular structures and the inequalities of power associated with them are vital to the rise and fall of discourses. (C)HM regards discourse between states and government actors to be the most important sphere for analysis within the international system.

The fight against terrorism has redirected international attention and resources towards eradicating insecurities as part of the recognition of the multilevel factors facilitating the emergence of terrorism. Specifically this involves the controlling of the proliferation of arms. (B)The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism. The problem thus far is that no one case of enforced neo-liberalism, either through conditionalities, regime change, peace-building, has succeeded in transforming a weak state into a strong state. (C)The failure of liberal reform has highlighted the increasing viability of the option of alternative forms of political organization beyond the state. Sub-state organizations are a practical solution to dealing with regions with endemic problems of weapons and poverty, whilst regional organization is a sustainable structural form in Africa and Latin America. (D)Weak states have embarked on a protracted and difficult process to attain effective status. Long term security strategies have resulted in the adoption of measures to counteract the worst of the effects including the establishment of multi parties, economic liberalization and membership of the international community.", "output": ["B"]}, {"id": "task733-54fed418442a4de3b53bfcc958f468d0", "input": "Which statement best describes Booth's attitude toward constructivism and post-structuralism within Critical Security Studies?\n(A)Post-structuralism provides no basis for political action, being a dangerous mix of faux radicalism, relativism and obscurantism, whilst constructivism is an orientation to world politics rather than a specific political theory. (B)Constructivism offers a number of specific political theories applicable to Critical Security Studies but all of these lack the tenability required in security studies. Post-structuralist theories similarly lack the durability desired by CSS scholars. (C)Post-structuralism and constructivism are ill-defined theories that are better described as political orientations, applicable in vague terms but lacking the substance required by scholars in contemporary security studies. (D)Constructivism is too dangerous a mix of political ideologies, combining elements of radicalism and relativism. Post-structuralism is more of an orientation to world politics rather than a specific and applicable political theory.", "output": ["A"]}, {"id": "task733-b88bcde7e4b14b079fdc7efc6e2f2a28", "input": "Since the end of the Cold War, how has the use of coercive diplomacy by Western powers changed?\n(A)Coercive diplomacy has proven a successful policy tool and one that is integral to conflict management. The successes of the past policy initiatives in the post-9/11 community have reinforced the trend toward coercive diplomacy by increasing American political will to counter mass casualty terrorism in failing states. (B)The favourable geo-political environment, characterized by an overwhelmingly Western military superiority and a low risk of hostile great power intervention, has generated pressures and incentives for Western policymakers to promote their policy agenda, and to manage armed conflicts from weak states and failing states. (C)The demise of the ideological bipolar division of international society in the Cold War, rather than resulting in a reduction of hostilities, has left an unstable legacy where a policy of force and mass retaliation continues to pose a very real threat. Risk of uncontrollable escalation still remains but in a different form; mass casualty terrorism, contagion from failing states and non-state actors seeking to acquire WMD are the primary concern of states and require responses in the form of military intervention. (D)The hostile geopolitical environment has encouraged states to pursue military strategies in order to secure their interests. The use of violence rather than diplomacy or incentives has become the primary response to threats, whether these are posed by other states, resource scarcity, pandemic diseases, or other non-traditional threats.", "output": ["B"]}, {"id": "task733-8b10d392d37949a7ab0036ab3c50c74d", "input": "Which of the following is not an advantage of cooperation between states?\n(A)Potential for arms control and unilateral restraint. (B)Improvement of political relationships between states. (C)To appear cooperative is to appear as a 'security seeker', thus encouraging further cooperation from neighbour states.

(B)An 'energy security nexus' exists where two states directly contend for access to the same, often limited, energy resource, such as oil reserves. (C)An 'energy security nexus' exists in the international system because the geographical distribution of energy supply and demand are not equal; thus states are drawn into complex and intertwined relationships with one another. (D)An 'energy security nexus' exists in the global system as a result of strategic planning by oil-rich states to ensure that the geographical distribution of supply and demand is not equal.", "output": ["C"]}, {"id": "task733-3b7c95dc9a9e4331961455831e01b6b8", "input": "Traditional approaches seek to explain why and how states have sought security. Which answer best describes the approach of traditional Security Studies?\n(A)Traditional theories explain international politics as the distribution of power among members of an international system, and specifically as the balance of power amongst major states. The relative power and the constraints of a state are reflective of the security strategy of that state. (B)The traditional approaches emerged in response to the Cold War, and to the accumulation of tension and competition between the two Superpowers. Traditional theories seek to explain behaviour in terms of arms accumulation. (C)Traditional conceptions emerged to explain the clusters of norms and patterns of behaviour that result in management of conflict and cooperation in the international system, in specific spheres of activities. (D)Traditional approaches are concerned with sovereignty. Sovereignty is a legal status; it gives the state control over a specified territory, means it is free from arbitrary intervention, and is responsible to no higher authority. Traditional theories examine the patterns of behaviour and relative cooperation of sovereign states in the international system.", "output": ["D"]}, {"id": "task733-3e8e5db735a840b08c01100e30e89b50", "input": "How many people are estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS worldwide?\n(A)Below 20 million (B)20-30 million (C)30-40 million (D)40-50 million", "output": ["C"]}, {"id": "task733-2b0a692a7b0d4b20b4f1e40428edd613", "input": "Which of the following events can be regarded as contributing to the emergence of environmental security during the 1960s and 1970s?\n(A)From the 1970s a number of scholars attempted to critique orthodox security discourse and practices, highlighting their inability to manage environmental risks to national and international security. (B)There became a growing recognition that environmental changes do not merely pose risks to ecosystems - they also pose risks to human well-being.

Accordingly, different governments will identify different threats and react in different ways. (B)Social constructivists tend to focus on the population rather than military as an area for study, thus regarding the process of militarization largely in terms of its impact on human security. (C)Social constructivists assert that the process follows a popular recognition of empirically definable threats; when it is recognized that an issue poses a real and valid threat, it warrants militarization. (D)In their uniform advocacy of human security and adoption of a human-centric approach to security studies, social constructivists regard militarization as a process that is detrimental to achieving wider security goals and actively encourage the demilitarization of the security system.", "output": ["A"]}, {"id": "task733-7005b03f5762458da8fedb470412ea52", "input": "How can we define the role of the state in achieving human security?\n(A)The state is the most prominent threat in terms of committing violent acts against humans, thus directly threatening human security.

(B)In 1973 the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) restricted oil supplies which underlined the industrial capacity of the military leaving a profound psychological impact requiring that security be linked to national interests: the securing of energy deals and the environment became related to military capability diplomacy. (C)Ideologically driven military security was replaced by a need to preserve territorial integrity in wake of the collapse of communism. Military security was a high priority given the threat of spill-over. The environment remained a peripheral concern to the security institutions occupied with the new security environment post-Cold War. (D)The end of the Cold War order created the intellectual space for the broadening of security issues beyond Cold War military mentalities. Research among political and environmental scientists discussed ways in which new security issues could be addressed. The plethora of publications produced, however, had little effect on policy.", "output": ["A"]}, {"id": "task733-8fe65a8fd2004d659ba906c0a2d96a3e", "input": "What has been the effect of chemical weapons on international society?\n(A)The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. (B)The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks. (C)Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability. (D)While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations.", "output": ["D"]}, {"id": "task733-410b26fbc1b942cc9d78e5e74cfb47fb", "input": "In which of these wars did the overwhelming technological superiority of one side lead to rapid defeat of its enemy?\n(A)Vietnam War.

(B)Knowledge was regarded as subjective and doubts were cast on whether any empirically testable 'truths' or realities could be defined for certain. (C)Traditional security studies adopt a positivist approach, based in scientific objectivism that pursues the definition of specific 'truths' that can be empirically tested and validated.

The behaviour of consumers dictates the nature of the global system. (C)Behaviour, as a social constructivist concern, is not relevant to economic theory or security theory in general.
