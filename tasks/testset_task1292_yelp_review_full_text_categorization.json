None of them impressed me much, they were cooked medium which is the only choice for sliders but it was only medium in the very center, the rest was a little too cooked (probably due to the small size). The Hostess seemed extremely unhappy when I arrived with my friends and when i left i said bye, she bid me farewell with the same sad state of emotion... kinda killed it. As i was saying, the burgers lacked any \\\"interesting\\\" flavors despite the delicious description in the menu. The sliders were quite small and overall just didn't impress me as far as taste. Even though each burgers used different beef, they all tasted much the same. Presentation was pretty and the fat fries were pretty good but that just didn't cut it for a $20+ bill... i was gonna go for the ballin 60 dollar burger with truffles etc but opted not to at the last moment.

Lately, though, I've been staying at MGM more and more often just because the other properties seem to be going downhill.  Monte Carlo is one such property.\\n\\nCasino:\\n\\nThe casino was OK and had a good vibe.  My only annoyance here was a pit boss totally ignoring me betting $20-$30 per round on roulette because I was using the $1 chips (it was a $5 minimum table at the time).  After several rounds he finally came over and offered to explain how the comps work and that we need to bet a lot more than the minimum to be noticed.  Really?  Well if you'd been watching, you'd have seen that I just dropped $400 on the stupid table.  He did try to make up for it once he noticed how annoyed I was, though, so that was cool.  Also, it didn't help that the dealer at the roulette table was totally uninterested and kept looking off in the distance and yawning.  I don't think the employees are very happy here.\\n\\nHotel:\\n\\nThe hotel is \\\"eh\\\".  My standard rant at any of these properties are their so called \\\"queen sized\\\" beds.  They are NOT queen sized beds!  They're doubles!!  Don't advertise that you're getting a queen size when it's a tiny little double!!  The pillows were like 2 foot tall bricks the first night.  I asked housekeeping for better pillows for the second night and they brought some feather pillows up which were much nicer.\\n\\nThe rooms are VERY loud.  I could hear people coughing and sneezing a floor up and below from me and also next door.  The plumbing is really really loud, too, and at one point was making a really loud hummm for hours.   I was awoken each morning around 6AM  and couldn't get back to sleep because of all of the noise.  Not a good way to encourage me to stay up all night gambling :(\\n\\nGo to MGM.  It'll be much nicer.",

After squeezing into a parallel parking spot out front, I had two things on my mind when walking in here: hotdogs and beer, both of which they have down pat.\\n\\nSince it was mid-afternoon, few tables were filled, but the front patio was open to allow in some fresh air during the nice day. I first looked around at their extensive beer selections; \\\"six pax\\\" in the rear \\\"Beer Cave\\\" and individual bottles in the middle cooler. I found something to my liking and grabbed a high table and menu.\\n\\nA \\\"Big Ben\\\" dog sounded appetizing (and mildly appropriate), but I ended up going with the \\\"Mason Dixon\\\" topped with chili and coleslaw. Knowing that one dog would not be enough, I also went with a small order of their \\\"Pub Fries\\\" covered in cheese and bacon. (Forgive me Father, for I have no restraint.)\\n\\nHoly Moley! Both the dog and fries were excellent and down right tasty. Thank God because my satisfied stomach was smacking down the guilty part of my brain that was subconsciously calculating the summation of calories shared between the meal and two bottles of liquid refreshment.\\n\\nOh well. I definitely heart D's, even if my heart now hates me in return. 4.5 Stars.",

The flour tortilla is only a vehicle to get the array of smoked meats into your mouth. So you SoCal kids looking for a delicate corn tortilla can quit now.  Smoke is its own genre.\\n\\nYes it is small and sometimes slow. Suck it up, good things come to those who wait. They don't take reservations but here is a tip. Go put your name in and then walk around corner to Blue Dust and have a drink. Smoke will call your cell when a table is ready. Bring cash and your own booze. They have fresh margarita mixers so half a bottle of tequila is a good addition. If booze isn't your style, try the horchata.\\n\\nMy favorite is the rib taco. I liken it to a McRib sandwich with great ingredients. The brisket, chicken apple, veggie and BLT are all standouts.  One of the best things on the menu is the breakfast taco. Served all day, it is great anytime and you can add a meat of your choice to it.  \\n\\nOne of the secrets of smoke is the wings. They are only available on Thursdays and they run out, but man oh man are they amazing. Smoked then fried, these are spicy and awesome.\\n\\nIf you are really lucky you will be there on a day that someone has baked. The chocolate brownie with peanut butter marscapone frosting are amazeballs!",

They take no blame here.\\n\\nProbably the best fare here is the burgers -- they are hard to mess up, and you can always add more condiments.\\n\\nThis week I was there twice -- first with a group where we had appetizers and dinner.  I had some form of a spring-roll, a Caesar salad, and a salmon entree the first night, and another Caesar and a sandwich made from short-ribs.\\n\\nI realized that it is highly probable that the kitchen must consist of a row of deep-fat fryers and microwaves since most of the fare is either fried or re-heated.  Having eaten the fare here, and noted others' plates, it seems that they must be purchasing pre-cooked items from Costco or an equivalent warehouse store and just reheating.\\n\\nCertainly the appetizers are frozen-fare -- that seemed obvious (and not unusual for this type of venue.  But clearly the perfectly rectangular pieces of fish soaked in tangy sauce is also from the deep-freeze, as is the meat which purpotedly is a short-rib (it appeared more like my great-grandmothers pot-roast, except for the gooey, somewhat coagulated, fat).\\n\\nNow, I actually kind of like that kind of food -- but not so much when the frozen salmon filet, easily purchased at about $3/filet, was served for nearly $24, and a sandwich made of short-ribs contained more bread, filler, and grease than meat (again, with a deference to frozen concoction) for $12.95 -- and the \\\"caesar\\\" salad for $6.95 which was just a regular old chopped iceberg lettuce salad with a squirt of cheap pseudo-caesar dressing, no croutons, no cheese, no bread, no nothin'\\n\\nThe problem here is value -- it's just far to highly priced for the quality of the product which is served.\\n\\nOn a side note -- they apparently have live entertainment on certain nights -- from what I experienced, I would suggest a better vetting process -- old-guy with guitar who fries the PA system first, then has no volume at all later, doesn't help.  Amateur night is best left for other venues which cater to cheap karaoke.",

When the bestie invited me to dine there during their 3rd anniversary, the two most popular dishes of Linguini Uni Tomato Cream and the Spaghetti \\\"Ikasumi\\\" Squid Ink were half-off the normal price ($26.95 and $19.95, respectively).  Trusting that girlfriend wouldn't steer me wrong, I figured this would be an excellent time to finally try these exotic (to me) dishes.  Arriving around 6:00pm on a Wednesday, there was a line at the door as expected.  Checking in with the hostess, you can leave your phone number and get a call when your table is ready.  We waited 45 minutes for a table to open up.  Once seated, we were waited on quickly.  We ordered both the uni and squid ink pastas, more than enough for the two of us to share.  The Linguini Uni arrived at the table first and it was definitely delicious; I really loved the tomato cream sauce.  I couldn't really distinguish the taste of the uni, however, so I will have to try uni in another dish some other time.  The squid ink spaghetti came next and I was already getting full from the uni dish.  Other than its black color, this pasta is not as scary as it looked (to me).  If you tasted it blindfolded, you would not expect it to be squid ink or black; it tasted a bit garlicky and was very flavorful.  But, the uni was my favorite of the two and I would have it again.  Japanese and Italian fusion is an interesting concept and I look forward to another visit to try the Miso Carbonara and to have more of the uni.",

PS I should mention, the wait staff, albeit a little overwhelmed by the crowd for Valentine's Day lunch, were VERY COURTEOUS and WONDERFUL to me. ALL very friendly and attentive.",

I used to work not far away, however, and from 1998 until perhaps 2003, it wasn't.  It still isn't, in fact.  It has done nothing but go downhill.  It's amazing that they are still open.\\n\\nIf you want to go, I'd probably suggest lunch, because the dinner service is almost scary - it is scary if it's after dark.  The parking lot is a wasteland, and I live near Eastland Mall if that tells you anything.\\n\\nIn any case, the good news is that you don't have to wait long for a table at most times of the day, and you seem to get about the same amount of food at lunch or at dinner, though at dinner you get just a bit more food for a hefty increase in price.  If you visit regularly, give them an extra dollar and you can get a gold card where you get Kabuto Bucks that you can use to save money the next time you come back.\\n\\nThe food isn't authentic Japanese, but come on.  It's not like we have authentic Chinese or Italian or Mexican in most places in this country either.  It's just what we expect.  The show isn't really a show either - it's just a bunch of rattling around.  Usually you'll get a bit of spilled oil that is set aflame.  If you're lucky, you get a tossed egg cracked on a spatula.  Maybe a volcano made from an onion, and that's it.\\n\\nWhat I find is that the food is pretty tasty - sure it's cooked in oil and a monstrous tub of butter.  But that's what makes it good.  The chicken is tasty, the steak is as well.  I'm not a sushi eater, but the California Rolls are good to my taste buds (better than you'll find on most buffets).",

I ordered the special of the day, New England clam chowder, one of my favorite soups, so I knew what to expect. Unexpectedly I received runny soup that only resembled the same color as clam chowder with far less of the yummy ingredients that I would have expected from such a pricy place. We also decided to split a nice wedge salad. Having eaten wedge salads in hundreds of other establishments, we thought for sure that this staple of fine dining was easily replicated by any restaurant and felt comfortable with our decision. When we received our salad, the runny blue cheese dressing was void of any real blue cheese and after my wife and I split up the bacon bits, we each got three bits of bacon. My wife enjoyed a petite filet and decided to add shrimp to the meal. For an extra 16.00 we got 3 small shrimp that were over cooked. $5.3333 per shrimp is a little outrageous. \\n\\nOverall, the meats were well prepared, the service was very acceptable, the ambiance is fantastic but the food was sub-standard at best compared with other restaurants of similar price range. \\n\\nPS: I was warned about the decline of the food since new ownership from an avid foodzonian. but I decided to find out myself, should have listened..",

How many Louis Vuittons, Cartiers, and Jimmy Choos does Las Vegas Boulevard really need?\\n\\nAnyway, the mall it pretty nice and architecturally interesting.  I do agree with Judd that it's set up haphazardly and you can wind up going down a corridor to nothing.\\n\\nAs for the stores, every time I've been there all the stores are completely dead.  In fact, I see most employees playing with their phones.  People dressed up in suits standing around jewelry worth thousands of dollars and they are leaning up against the cases bored out of their minds and texting their friends.  I worked retail for several years and would have been fired for doing something like that. I digress.\\n\\nI understand that while in the planning phase and even during the initial building of Crystals the economy was a lot better off and this might have made sense.  Then everything went to the crapper and they weren't even sure how they were going to finish City Center.  Remember when MGM almost went bankrupt from it?  I understand there may have been contracts and such to deal with, but someone at MGM should have realized they needed to change their game plan and put in at least a few affordable stores in this mall. \\n\\nThere are also a few restaurants, most of them overpriced as well.  \\n\\nFor the rich and famous, this is a 5 star place for you to spend your money.

The South Park location is hard to find (maps app takes you to the wrong section) and no one working in Piedmont Row or walking around seemed to know of this place. Seems like a sign board or better advertising might be useful. \\n\\n2.  Fresh cooked would definitely be better but I didn't get that option. I went at 5:00 on a Sunday afternoon, and was told that all waffles are made in the morning then wrapped in plastic wrap. I bought several frozen to take home for others but thought that the fresh one would actually be freshly cooked. It was wrapped in plastic the same as the frozen ones so there was absolutely no justification for paying twice as much. At that point, my credit card has already been charged so there was no turning back. \\n \\n3.  The afternoon counter guy was not the most helpful. When I asked him a question about the syrup, rather than answering in words, he merely flung out his arm pointing at the syrup behind him. I had to repeat my question in 2 different ways before he actually answered. I was the only customer in the restaurant and it was still 3 hrs before closing, so I'm not sure what the problem was. \\n\\nAfter taking the waffles home and reheating them, I did think they were good.

            "input": "The first time I came here with my boyfriend, it was really late at night (midnight), so it was pretty quiet.  We ordered the stuffed jalape\\u00f1os.  If I recall correctly, we only got a few and it was sort of pricey; I don't think we're going to order them again.  The bartender that was working that night was really awesome; he was really friendly and talkative.  He was always checking if we wanted another drink just as we were finishing our current ones.  I'm not a huge drinker, but I decided to give the soju lemon drop a try (I do like soju).  When I downed that, he asked if I wanted another one or if I wanted to try something else.  I didn't know what I wanted, but was open to anything, so the bartender said he'd mix up another soju drink for me.  He said he could make anything.  When he came back with it, it was different, but I liked it.  I forgot if it had a name, but it had some ginger and maybe basil in it.  I forget what else.  He said my second drink was free because I'd been gambling the whole time I was there (didn't lose much. :D).  I don't suppose they do that for everyone, so I thought that was really nice.  I didn't get his name, but he was a stocky guy and I think he had spiked hair. \\n\\n01/22/11 Edit: After a recent trip there, my bf said that he's not liking this place so much anymore cuz the last couple of times we were playing video poker and stuff, none of our drinks got comped, but we get them comped at another bar we go to (read further into my review).  Guess it's a more common practice than I previously thought.\\n\\nAnyway, for our second visit, the female bartender wasn't so friendly.  She wasn't rude or anything, but she just gave us our drinks, the menus, and came back occasionally to check if we needed refills.  It was also a slow night.  I thought she'd be more attentive then, but nope.\\n\\nThe last time we were there, about a week ago, we'd gone on the weekend and it was so busy.  The first two times we were able to sit at the bar, but we had to find a table this time since it was so packed and we even had trouble finding one of those.\\n\\nI can understand people being short with others if they're stressed or busy, but I've been working in customer service since I started working back in high school and I've never treated anyone like that before, no matter what kind of mood I was in.\\n\\nThe waitress we had seemed like that when she asked for my boyfriend's ID after he ordered a drink.  We dismissed it at first because of the high volume of customers, but I started getting pissed when we waited half an hour for the check.  She just didn't come to our section of the restaurant.  When she did, she spent those five minutes chatting it up with some people in the corner table -- people she knows, I'm guessing.  We probably could've asked one of the bussers or gone up to the bartender or something, but we weren't in a rush and we were very involved in a conversation anyway.  Still, though, we were keeping track of where she WASN'T coming and for how long.  I think she's the same waitress that Tony H. mentioned in his review.  The good thing about this visit was the Cheeto's onion rings.  If you like hot stuff, I recommend you try them cuz they're breaded with Flaming Hot Cheeto's.  Make sure you dip them in the sriracha for the additional heat (it's the thicker sauce; they'll give you a sweet one, too, which is watery, but also good).\\n\\nThe next time (next three times actually) we went out for drinks and food, we went to Five Star Tavern a few blocks south on Aliante and had a much better experience.  (See my review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/five-star-tavern-north-las-vegas-2#hrid:Yr1UAjXPkb0HJ3tyz4m-Xw)\\n\\nSomeone else mentioned the architecture in a review (looks like it wasn't here; forgot where I saw it).  I thought it did look pretty neat, but at the same time I thought, WHY would you have the beams that go from the floor to the ceiling also go through the tables (see the picture that someone shared here to see what I mean)?  That's wasted seating right there; they take up enough table space for a person to sit at.  I thought it the first time I went, but since it was so busy during my last visit and there weren't many spots available, I was really wondering why they decided to do that.\\n\\nAn okay experience overall (except that one waitress who hates her life).  The food's pretty good.  On top of the onion rings, we've had the tuna melt panini, caesar chicken wrap, bratwurst, cheeseburger, and chicken fajita -- not all at one time, of course. :P  It was all good.",

I finally got someone's attention and asked about repair work - so they called over their repair \\\"specialist\\\".  I showed her the bag and and she said since someone \\\"other\\\" then LV had made a zipper repair to the bag, they \\\"would not touch it\\\".   She practically threw it back at me and when I asked her for a shopping bag, she went out of her way to find me a PLAIN white shopping bag. I was so completely offended  - she didn't offer to show me a new bag, clean the old one  or engage me in any way.  If she had, I might have purchased a new bag.\\n\\nI've never been treated so shabbily by a sales person in my life.  I had several other purchases with me and was obviously in a shopping mood - I ended up walking into the  Chanel boutique at the Wynn and was treated wonderfully and had great time.  I specifically went to that Louis Vuitton store based on the reviews here on Yelp, but was very disappointed.  I would bypass this store entirely and go to Chanel for a purse - you'll have a much better experience and won't be treated like scum by a snooty little shop girl.",

We were just staying two nights and did not plan to spend too much time in the room so we figure so long as we had a clean room with a king size bed we would be all set.\\nWhen we got there we were cheerfully told that we had been upgraded from a \\\"cozy\\\" room to a \\\"wonderful\\\" room.  It was explained that this room would have more space.\\nWe were also offered a special \\\"service\\\".  I forget the name they used but if we used this \\\"service\\\" we would get the satisfaction of being \\\"green\\\".  What was this service?  While we would get extra towels so that they would last us the three days and enough shampoo, soap and T.P, once they stocked our room with these things we would get no maid service.  Our bed would not be made, the bathroom would not be cleaned and the carpet would not be vacuumed. How is this being green?  I'm not sure.  We declined even though the way they tried to make us feel guilty was so endearing and tempting.\\nWe got to our room to discover that we had what looked like a full size bed.  I'm pretty sure it would've been physically impossible for the room to be any smaller: take one step and there's the bed, a step to the right and stub your toe on the desk. Turn around and stub your toe on the oversize chair almost obscuring the TV.  I cant' even picture how small the \\\"cozy\\\" room must be (I suspect it does not even exist and they tell everyone they have been \\\"upgraded\\\")\\nWe called the desk to let them know that we had booked a king size bed and that's what we wanted.  We were informed that we were wrong but if we wanted to upgrade to a king size we would have to take the only one left  in the whole hotel which was booked to capacity and which was on the third floor and this was not recommended as the noise from the bar would be unbearable.  Would we like to check the third floor? Before going downstairs to check the room my husband looked at the confirmation email which clearly stated we had booked a king size bed. After my husband showed the person at the desk the reservation email she miraculously found a room for us on the 9th floor.  I guess they were not so booked after all.\\nOnce we got settled we discovered that Wi-Fi connection would cost us $15.00 a night.  Hurrah!  Amazing how roadside motels can manage to let you connect for free but this overpriced place can't afford to.\\nThe cherry on top of this experience was all the bizarre charges they added (valet parking even though it was included in the original price.  Sending a fax that we never sent, and other obscure charges).\\nNever again will I stay at this place and I will be sure to avoid other W hotels.",

We had made reservations and we were seated underneath the gigantic crystal dragon.  The decor was very oriental yet contemporary.\\n\\nLet me start of with a disclaimer though- you cannot compare this place to Wing Lei, as other reviewers have done.  Not only is Red 8 in the casual dining tier versus Wing Lei's fine dining classification, but Red 8 is meant to cater to a different crowd.  Tourists, yes, but a different type of tourist.  One who doesn't want to splurge on food, just wants something quick to eat, or wants a Pan-Asian meal because essentially, that is what Red 8 serves.\\n\\nA reviewer earlier described this place pretty accurately- a Panda Express on steroids.  Just throw in some Indonesian, Thai, and Cantonese dishes in there and you're all set.\\n\\nThe food was pretty good- nothing stunning, but something worth its money.  I had the pineapple fried rice, which was very nice since I don't know of any other restaurant that makes that.  And actually, we were all mooching off of each others' dishes, so I can't remember everything I ate!  All I know is that I would go to Red 8 again- not too often, but if there's a small occasion to celebrate.\\n\\nI'm giving this place 3 stars because of the food.  Noodles Restaurant and other casual dining restaurants that are similar to Red 8 deliver much better in terms of food.  I can't fault the service- it was flawless.  They were vibrant and worth going back just for to see them again.  Sadly, I can't say the same for the food.",

Let that sink into your head before I tell you about Ranch House.\\n\\nI visited Scottsdale for Memorial weekend this year.  On our first morning there, my partner and I had just finished a little morning hike at Papago and decided that we should have some brunch.  We found this gem thanks to Yelp.\\n\\nThis place is a straight-up no nonsense down home cafe.  There's country music playing faintly in the background and it's the kind of place that probably has a lot of regulars.  It's seat-yourself style so you just go in and pop a squat at a table.\\n\\nI have been to some pretty spectacular \\\"world-class\\\" famous restaurants here in LA, but Ranch House had the best waitress I have ever encountered.  A friendly young girl came over and introduced herself (think her name was Ashley) and this girl is seriously the best waitress I've ever had, and like I said I've eaten at Michelin star places.\\n\\nAt Ranch House, you pretty much just order how many eggs you want and what kind of meat you want.  Everything comes with hash browns and then either toast, pancakes or biscuits n gravy.  Ashley informed us that her favorite was the biscuits n gravy so we of course had to take her up on them.\\n\\nI got bacon and my partner got the 8 oz steak.  He ordered it rare, because he likes medium rare but places usually cook things too well from what you say so he was assuming it would actually come out medium rare.\\n\\nWell, it didn't, it came out straight-up rare and all cold in the middle.  I know this is totally all his fault for ordering it rare.  Ashley brought it out and immediately read his mind.  She asked if he really wanted it that rare or if he wanted it taken back to be thrown on for a few minutes--he obliged her and it came back PERFECTLY medium rare.  We both proceeded to feel dumb, btw.\\n\\nAnyway, my bacon was floppy and thick-cut and I loved it.  The scrambled eggs were perfect.  The hash browns were some of the best I've ever had.  Loved every single thing about the meal.  Even their coffee here is brewed stuff and was a perfect wake-me-up after an early morning hike in the desert.  They put cucumber and lemon in the ice water which I liked as well.\\n\\nAshley was so patient, so attentive and did every single thing asked of her perfectly.\\n\\nFor a $25 bill I tipped Ashley $20 and left her a thank you note.  She earned it.\\n\\nSo we came back a second time just before we hit the road to leave Scottsdale and come back to LA.  This time we had an older lady with short hair who was also amazing.  The waitstaff here really cares about the restaurant and really cares about their jobs.  Once again my food was cooked perfectly.  This time the partner tried an omelette and it was seriously GINORMOUS.  For $10, he got an enormous omelette (which I'm pretty sure contained an ENTIRE avocado) and biscuits & gravy.  What a good deal.\\n\\nAnytime in the future I come back through the Phoenix metro, I'm probably going to make it a point to go out of my way to eat here.\\n\\nLike I said, I've never given a 5-star review before, but Ranch House TOTES earned it.",

Fist off who builds a door that walks right into the toilet washroom. It was awkward to enter the building and dodge a woman coming out of the bathroom to wash her hands. The waitstaff were all hanging around the bar gleaming over the one seated table, and the welcome was less than enthusiastic. Our food was waiting for us on the bar and I paid and left as quickly as possible. We ordered the following: combo pho minus the tripe, veggie pho, chicken pho and some spring rolls. Now my wife is vegan and is very attentive to what she orders. Rice Paper claimed the broth to be vegitarian, however when we got into mixing our soup we noticed that it was the same broth as the other soups we ordered. The broth was overly salted and didn't have the nice fragrant smell like other places that don't suck. My brother ordered the Pho without tripe and guess what? They gave him tripe. My chicken Pho was mediocre and with enough lime juice and Sriracha tasted fine. Had the soup been descent, had the experience picking up my food been pleasant the prices are not so bad. All in all we spent $40 bucks for the experience to cross this restaurant off the list. Next time the wifey wants Pho, I'll spend the extra gas to get to Tempe.",

I have been a long time fan of Giada  & was super excited to have the chance to eat at her restaurant.  After finally arriving at the restaurant  last night, I checked in with the greeter and was asked if I wanted to go in early since my wife &  I arrived early. My wife checked that the dress attire for the restaurant  is \\\"business casual\\\"  based on their website. I was wearing blue shorts &  a capped sleeved (  very short, short sleeved) Guess hooded sweater.  While waiting to be seated, another woman who didn't  introduce herself came from inside  the restaurant  & told me  that there was a dress code &  I wouldn't  be able to get in unless I changed clothes.  Being that I wasn't staying at the Cromwell, that was not something I could do.  I told this woman that I have been  a long time fan of Giada since her cooking show days and all I wanted to do was eat dinner at Giada 's restaurant for my wife' s bday.  All I wanted was a little customer service and to be pardoned for my capped sleeve shirt. She just turned her head,  gave me a  fake smile  that read \\\"that's  nice but I really don't give a shit\\\"  &  proceeded with telling me that I still won't  be able to get in unless I changed clothes.  She said I had \\\"torn off sleeves\\\"  and that was the problem. .  but mind you..  my shirt is once again CAPPED Sleeve that  go pass my shoulders and it was a Guess brand.  It was not a $10 ripped tank top from old Navy as she implied. While this is all happening, I notice  3 or 4 guys go inside to eat with blue shorts on and  t-shirts.  So here is my question...  What was the difference  between what I had on and THEIR outfits ????  \\n\\nI get that there's a dress code and rules like this need to be followed by the people  who conduct this business.  What I  didn't  appreciate was the condescending  approach and how that woman made me feel that this snobby atmosphere  is something that they're  trying to uphold & that me and my capped sleeved shirt don't have a place in there.  (Imagine that \\\"Pretty Woman\\\" scene w/Julia Roberts  when she was dressed as a hooker and that snobby lady didn't wanna help her because of how she looked.. All Julia wanted was to buy a nice dress and she had $$$!!) \\n\\nI thought that as a fan of Giada  (who this woman  probably  didn't  even know  of until she worked at the restaurant) AND as a paying customer that  a few  more inches of length  on my sleeves  wouldn't  be so  significant. I was naive. I had to seriously re-evaluate  being a fan because her establishment represents her like THIS.\\n\\nI'm sure your food is extraordinary  (I can only imagine it in the pictures because I didn't  get to taste it!!)  But your customer service  needs a SERIOUS upgrade!!!",

I was on my own (more on that later) so I didn't want to order too much so I just got a burger. Sweet & Spicy is the way to go, it was absolutely amazing. Fresh fluffy bun, sweet, spicy, a little smokey, great meat, and perfectly assembled. You'd have to have zero culinary experience to not like this burger.\\n\\nSo went a five star review when I finished my iced tea, and waited.... waited... and waited for another. The bartender who initially took my order must have walked by me 8-10 times and finally the other bartender got me another, but not before I had to flag him down. If they were truly too busy for words, this would have been perfectly acceptable, however they were not. There was one conversation about what shots they were having last night, so I expect that rather than make personal conversation, you do your job. From the point when I complained, to the end of my meal, they were spot on and she was very apologetic, if a little fake though. \\n\\nThe other issue I have with this place, and this does not affect my star rating because it's out of the restaurants control, is the crowd that hangs out here.

Oh, and the eggs benedict had hard yolks - yuck! (the $13 buffet at the Palms even got the yolks runny!) The dessert spread was impressive, but nothing was amazing.

We waved down the waitress, and she grabbed the plate and said she could bring another. A bit later she returned and dropped off the quesadilla. It was another steak quesadilla...and cold. We waved down the waitress again and told her it was steak again and to just take it off the bill. She looked at my friend and said, \\\"well then, the first one was chicken\\\" and walked away. No apology, just attitude. It was clearly not chicken either time. She returned, literally threw the book with the check on it on the table and walked away, saying nothing else. \\n\\nWe tracked down a manager, who took care of the tab.

However, at just over $1/wing I can't help but feel kind of ripped off. \\n\\nThe bulgogi was one of those things that I was happy to see as I typically only get to indulge in it in New York or DC/Northern VA.

Other than that it was a generous portion and the rest of the flavors hit the spot for what I'd consider decent bulgogi. \\n\\nThat brings us to the dumplings. These I would most certainly pass on! If they weren't from a bag of frozen dumplings from an Asian market then I have serious worries for the cook given that my first attempt at making homemade pork dumplings was light years ahead of what I got out of the dumplings here.

After three tries at getting a seating preference in an almost empty dining room (first: within a foot of a large table with several small children under the age of 3, second: facing into the industrial kitchen - not the \\\"show\\\" kitchen and again within uncomfortable proximity to a VERY large group - WTH?) we finally settled at a decent table with view outside.\\nWe were presented with breakfast (brunch) menus as the dining room doesn't switch until 3pm which was okay since I haven't been out for brunch in a while. Which opened up the possibility of ordering eggs bennie and some bubbles and vitamin C (mimosa). What I got was a cold plate with a huge amount of country fries (?), two cold, tough english muffins topped with (cold again) thin ham slices, which I'm sure are better suited for a samwich, and two lukewarm and very strange poached eggs. I fancy myself a bit of an egg snob being a grad of a world famous culinary school and for the life of me I don't know how the cooks had made such a debacle of these poor oeufs; slimy and undercooked on the outside and overcooked on the inside. Summoned our waiter, who by the way, was outstanding, hence even giving this Establishment any stars at all, and he took it back only to bring out another plate of the same mess at the same lukewarm temp. Now I've completely lost my appetite. Hubby had Mediterranean salad and said it was good but needed more stuff. The highlight of the service was the foccacia with pesto served to the table and my grandson's kids order of pasta with cheese and butter. Maybe I'm also giving a star for the ambiance which was okay, too.  With many other restaurants to choose from in the area, I doubt whether I'll be back to Olive & Ivy to give it a second chance.",

And for thirds, a lot of bands/singers/acts come to this venue during the summer - go figure.\\n\\nAlso, VERY expensive drinks. WTF, $13 for a 20oz can? C'mon.\\n\\nWith that said, I'm more of a pit concert goer or a lawn type person. I don't like to sit in a seat. Boring. If you sit on the lawn expect to have whatever you have sitting on the ground to be kicked 2 rows away. Not the people's fault - it is dark, they are drunk, and your shit blends in with the ground. \\n\\nAlso expect to have NO cell service. You will get it, but it is low. Therefore, your battery will be gone before the concert is over. So when you are wandering around on the lawn trying to find your blanket and your people, don't plan on calling them because everyone's phone was dead. I charged mine to 98% before entering the concert and at the end mine was the only one that was alive at all. The other FIVE people's phones were dead (and other people had their phones fully charged as well). We weren't taking video or anything else, either. If someone told me that the place had a cell phone jammer installed... I wouldn't doubt it for a second.\\n\\nNO SERVICE. So plan accordingly on how to find your party and plan ahead of how you are meeting to go home.\\n\\nThis place is expensive and I serioulsy thought I spent more time going to the bathroom and aimlessly wondering around the lawn tripping over everyone's shit than I did watching the show. I wish more acts picked other venues... or demanded that the prices aren't so high (like Kid Rock demanding that beer be sold for $4).",

EXCEPT - if you choose the balcony, DO NOT get the first row of seats on the balcony. You might think you're getting a great view, but the balcony bar will be in your way - whether you're tall or small - so pick the row just behind it. And unfortch, the ticket box office doesn't warn about this obstructed view. Secondly, floor seating and love seating does involve audience participation, so if you easily shy away from the spotlight, sit on the balcony. Oh, and go early for the pre-show.

The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time.

On that occasion I called and complained just to make the manger aware and she made it right and made it impossible to complain any further. This is an insider place that I tell and take out of town business guests to as well. Although I liked it more before the remodel when it was a bit more formal and different from Richardson's. Now the menus are much more similar but Rokerij has tapas items, I think they call small plates almost all of which are awesome, especially the Brie Toasts with Steak. I remember when they first changed the menu we went in and someone said, \\\"Wait a minute, this is the same as the damn Richardson's menu\\\", we looked at each other and said, \\\"Sweet\\\" and enjoyed our meals anyway. My cork-dork friends like the wine list and I like the cocktails. The atmosphere is nice but casual, dark wood, big booths, fireplace and etc. they have a decent bar downstairs (and one upstairs as well) where you can also eat if you want to sit in a line at the bar (also three booths and another fireplace with couch and club chairs) but it makes me a bit claustrophobic to be locked in there.

I loved my 2 bedroom-south tower suite, but that was about it.  Valet is good, check in not too bad, express check out is great.  The cocktail waitress service is sketchy, (just not enough of them on the floor).  Sports book needs some personality.  And come on, only 1 drink ticket per $100 bet!  Most places will give you 2 for a $50.  The pool was good.  I had an issue with a 2 for 1 offer for KA (which I received as part of my stay offer).  After 15 minutes the best they said they could do was charge me for the most expensive tickets and then they would honor the 2-1... I laughed.  Nowhere in my offer did it say that.   (Just another example of how this place sucks the juice out of your wallet)   Box office sent me to M Life to see what they could do.  The rep (Jan) was rude and unaccommodating.  Kept telling me they only did 30% off while I tried to show her my 2-1 email on my phone, but of course she didn't want to read it.  She had me speak to someone on the phone who apologized and basically said NOPE.  Finally just had to walk away while Jan was still going on and on...Very scammish.  Stay away from Wolfgang Pucks (that's a WHOLE diff story!)  Tried the \\\"real\\\" fitness center but they wanted an extra $10 per day to use it, and that's on top of the dreaded $25 per night resort fee.  The \\\"fake\\\" fitness center was free but only had cardio equip.  Slots don't play or pay with you (as most of the MLife casinos).   As for stays, this place is a one and done for me.",

So a friend of mine tells me on June 27th that I need to use my upgrade by tomorrow (June 28th) in order to renew my current contract and retain my unlimited data package. I called Verizon's customer service that day, the 27th, and asked them if that was necessary and they told me no, that it wasn't necessary for me to upgrade right then and that  my current plan wouldn't change at all. Specifically, my unlimited data plan. In an effort to cover all my bases I had my husband call and confirm this also. They told him the same thing, that nothing would change and that we did not need to upgrade until we wanted to. So fast forward to today, June 20th, I go into the Verizon store in Chandler on Frye road. The salesman tells me that upon upgrading I will need to decide on which new plan I would like to move to. I'm like, what?!?!?! I explained to him that I spoke with a Verizon representative back in June who assured me that I would not loose my current unlimited plan when I upgraded and signed the new 2 year contract. He told me, and these were his words, \\\"Well, the lied to you\\\"! WTH!!!!! I was majorly p'd off!!!!! I told him that I would not be upgrading anything until I called into the Verizon's customer service department to get this all worked out. So, I go home and we call and we get the same ol rigamarol from Terrence, the Verizon rep. Blah blah blah.... can I please speak to your manager... 15 minutes later (yes I was on hold for 15 minutes), Alisha the so called manager gets on the phone. She apologizes, not in a nice way, and says those plans are no longer available and that she can't help us. She says the reps did not know that the plans would no longer be available when we called in to ask the question. I call BS on that! I called one day before the new \\\"plans\\\" rolled out. You seriously ganna tell me that  the Verizon reps were left in the dark on that one. I think not! Long story short, she gets mad at me for saying that the Verizon rep and that Verizon itself are liars and hangs up on me. I am now going to shop around and look for another cell service provider. I feel I have been lied to and that they don't give a damn about their customers. I refuse to pay anyone for that kind of service. Good luck to all of you who have not upgraded yet.",

In fact, rather than admitting they were the ones that dropped the ball, when I called the restaurtant the day of my bday (and also the bday dinner), I asked to speak directly to Tammy after attempting to get ahold of her for a week and she started off by screaming like an absolute lunatic into the phone. She called me a liar and said I had never called and completely cut me off when I attempted to say anything to her. Talk about knowing how to run a business...wow.\\n\\nEven still, I understand she probably had a lot  going on and we had a very large party, but that doesn't excuse her lack of professionalism or the complete disregard for any of my attempts to get ahold of her. The least she could have done was call me back to tell me one way or the other if they could accommodate us or not. She was beyond disrespectful to not just me, but also my mother who attempted to calm her down after she laid into me. She told her that because I didn't text her, she had no idea about my dinner plans. Really Tammy? After talking to your employees and giving them specific details in the beginning of the week and then personally leaving voicemails with you twice before calling your restaurant again? And not only that, but TEXTING you?! That's the most pathetic, asinine excuse for first off, telling me I never called and secondly, for running a business professionally. \\n\\nBottom line: don't count on Pearl for any big events and don't expect Tammy to go the extra mile or even be enough of a decent human being to admit fault and try to fix the situation.

Our server was great, but running around taking care of too many tables at once, so I guess they were short staffed. \\n\\nI ordered the \\\"Chopped Salad\\\" priced at $13 and it had chopped romaine and iceberg lettuce, salami, cheese, tomatoes, avocados, cucumbers, celery and croutons. I asked that the red bell pepper and Italian dressing be left out. I wanted just extra blue cheese dressing, but my salad was tossed in the Italian dressing anyway and still had blue cheese dressing on it. I don't have an issue with the cost if the salad since it was a nice portion and had a lot of yummy sounding things in it, but all I tasted was a big pile of chunky bitter blue cheese, celery and really gross Italian dressing. Hubby had an overpriced $22 burger combo and said the burger tased frozen. The peanut butter shake he got I shared with him and that was actually good. I would just skip this place and go down the street to Tacos El Gordo!",

On multiple occasions now I've gone through the initial drop off process and then observed several cars be pulled into the wash ahead of mine.

Not only were they not keeping in cars in line BEFORE the wash, they were making the same mistakes after the wash.  Some cars (including mine) were placed at the end of a very long line and then several cars after mine were then placed near the front of another line.  This added even more time - and for a \\\"fast\\\" wash place like this I found it taking just shy of 40 minutes.\\n\\nThankfully the final employee that takes your claim check at least apologized and said they're often understaffed, but adequate staffing isn't the problem when they can't do something so simple as keep people in line with the order in which they arrived.  \\n\\nIf you're one of those optimists you could at least tell yourself that maybe you'll be one of the lucky ones whose car is moved up in line, both before and after the wash, and you'll be out of there in 10-12 minutes flat!",

All the tension in my neck and back became so much more apparent and I was counting the seconds till I had a day off. I haven't had a massage in a year!\\n\\nMASSAGE: They hit all areas of the body. Start with the shoulders, move to the head & scalp, and arms while your feet are soaking. Then off to the legs & feet. You'll flip over face down and then they'll go to town on the reverse side--neck, back, legs, the whole nine-yards. I had Song Lee (sp?) and boy did he really work my aching muscles. The rest of my body prefers a medium-firm handle. But when it comes to all the knots in my neck, shoulders, and back I really need someone to relentlessly work those puppies out. And he didn't disappoint!\\n\\nOUCH: Not gonna lie, he de-knotted every muscle in my back. In the following days, the skin there is still a tad tender. But no pain, no gain. All that tension back there is gone. One thing though, the towels are kind've rough. They really need to use more fabric softener or fluffier towels. When he's using that much muscle, the towel tends to rub my sensitive skin--and not in a good way. \\n\\nCLOTHING: You'll be fully clothed. For women, I recommend wearing some type of tank top and lounging pants of a thin cotton material. The pants should be able to roll up to your knees so they can work on your feet and legs. Also, when you're covered by towels and being rubbed down, it can get a little hot. You're not taking your clothes off so wear lightweight breathable materials. \\n\\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: Song Lee chimed in to make sure my comfort level was ok. I was uncomfortable during all the digging into my back but I knew I needed it--I didn't want him to let up! Next time, I'll probably ask for more neck/shoulders a little less foot. But I can't stress enough how polite and respectful he was. Rex checked me out and again, what a kind and polite person. \\n\\nPRICES: Mention Yelp, and you'll get a 10% discount.\\n               $34 = 60 mins (Org $38) ---I did this. Paid Credit Card.

The beer bread, omg that was soft and so good, you don't need any butter to put on it, it was perfect without!  I ordered the Popper Burger, which was a hamburger with lettuce and tomatoes, onion strings, fresh steamed jalapenos and cream cheese, came with fries. Let me tell you. The burger made my eyes water and lips burn, it was perfect!

It wasn't particularly crowed yet and we were seated inside where another group was also enjoying dinner. The hostess (a younger woman) seated us and after about 10 minutes were only greated with glasses of water from a bus boy, no server....nothing. Food was brought to the other patrons (couple different servers) but they were \\\"in and out\\\" so fast neither of us could get their attention.\\n\\nSo finally after another10-15 minutes, at about 15 minutes with no service at all we went and got our own drinks from the bar outside...I decide to go back to the host/hostess station and ask when our server is going to come and take our order. A young guy with an accent looks genuinely perplexed and walks with me to where we were seated. He had NO idea we'd been put there, the hostess said not a peep to anybody to help us. He seemed truly embarrassed and apologetic and had a female server come to our table immediately. She took our order (we went for the tapas, not bad) and then the male host came back and again apologized, saying that a miscommunication had occurred and the next round of drinks were on the house. He also brought out an appetizer on the house as well. Definitely appreciated the gesture and he promised to put in our food orders ahead of everybody else's as we had a show at 7:00pm. Food came out very quickly, as did the second round of beers. The shift manager, older lady, came over and she also apologized for the mix up and told us that she'd take a further percentage off our final bill. Again, we appreciated that...the attention we received helped to make up for the earlier blunder. I'd read that the service here in earlier posts was very poor but it looks like they make the effort and go the extra mile when mistakes happen...and mistakes are bound to happen!!!\\n\\nI had the roasted tomato soup (which was especially yummy) mac & cheese, ribs and a pollo something or other. I wasn't terribly \\\"blown\\\" away by the tapas as I've had better in town but would give the entrees a shot next time I'm in the area and want to stop in for a bite. Prices are higher that I felt was appropriate but I guess when you want to eat in the \\\"Art District\\\" that's what you'd expect? If I could give a 2 1/2 star rating that would be more fair but even with the earlier service FAIL and recovery the food wasn't stellar so 2 stars it is.",

We enjoyed them with the Nachos by You, which were a very healthy serving with delicious toppings.  We all ordered some kind of burger.  The menu offers 4 different choices.  They were cooked to order and very tasty.  With parmesan seasoned shoestring fries or homemade potato chips on the side our meal was complete.

The fact that it's owner operated, gives it its unique feel - what the feel is, however is yet to be clearly determined.  It's small, but cozy, quite but bustling, uniquely Turkish but feel like any number of places around the Concordia Campus.  Best is to pop in for take out.\\n\\nService: The lady behind the counter - always on her laptop pc - has a jovial smile, but can be stern if the mood doesn't strike her.  The owner, a short, burly man is the head cook (also makes the bread / pitas) speaks english with difficulty and although always happy to take customer's orders - can often been seen barking remarks / order as the 2 other employes on the counter lady.  Cute family-ish dynamic - but sometimes gives patrons an awkward feeling.\\n\\nFood:  The food however, is something else!  The fact that everything is made fresh, makes Antep's menu a treasured prize for the hungry student, traveller, err... everybody.  Prices have been on the rise (damn you inflation!) and Antep's sandwiches (kabab, shish taouk (chicken portions), kebab, and filet mignon) have gone up in price to $6 each.  Two of them should do the trick when you're hungry.  Everything is cooked on a charcoal grill & as an added bonus you can find many exotic soft drinks and juices at Antep (those from the Mediterranean part of Europe and the Middle East will recognize many of them).

No carrot, no beans, nothing else in the vegetable department. The shrimp tempura, however, was slightly mushy. \\n\\nAfter nearly an hour the Japanese pizza came out and was immediately returned because the dough was not cooked. At all. When queried they said the delay was caused by the time it takes to cook the dough. Clearly that was not the case. It is frustrating to be told the order was put in at the same time as the rest of the orders, yet when you finally receive the dish it clearly hasn't been cooked properly and clearly was rushed to the table. It was replaced with some tempura which was fine.\\n\\nThe worst part, and the part that hurts the review, was after the meal we all felt sick to our stomachs, rendering us useless for almost two hours.\\n\\nSuffice to say, we won't be returning and I have warned off the rest of my friends.",

First off, when we entered the building, nobody greeted us or acknowledged our existence for a good seven minutes. If you know anything about good customer service this is a red flag. It took them a good while to \\\"clean\\\" and set up the table for us which we didn't mind. When we were seated, we noticed the table was still wet, sticky, and disgusting. We had to use the napkins on the table to finish cleaning it up ourselves. The server didn't do such a good job at explaining the menu to us since it was our first time, it really felt like she knew almost nothing about the food here lol. After ordering, we waited, and waited, and waited. By now I was getting irritated because there was only a total of 3 small families in the restaurant which I didn't understand why it took them so long to bring the food out just so we can cook it ourselves. Usually when you bring food out, you should try to bring them all out at the same time, after awhile they only brought us lettuce and a small plate of thinly sliced beef. They had also brought out the two plates of mushroom that we had ordered but ended up giving those to the family next to us. COME ON, SERIOUSLY. We waited some more and they brought out a plate of assorted seafood. The funny thing is by now, we still haven't gotten our bowls of rice or noodles to eat along with the rest of the food. wtf. At least bring us small empty bowls so we could have scooped our food into it. Not once did they apologize for taking so damn long to bring us our food. When they finally brought us our rice, they only brought two bowls. There were six of us. Now, I'm just really trying to keep my cool. By the time we were done eating, they still haven't brought out my brother's roll of sushi, so we just cancelled it. I was pissed because it was my idea to take the family out to eat for once and ended up going to this place. We ended up paying $80 for a small plate of beef, a small plate of seafood, and some mushroom, with a side of terrible customer service. A word of advice to the owners of this place, retrain your employees and brush up on your management skills along with your customer service skills. It's embarrassing, really. Don't waste your time and money here. You want some good hot pot and better service, go to Shabu Grill on silverado ranch, its all you can eat too for about $20 a person.",

I was there a month ago and I am still mad now. \\n\\nSo here goes my story:\\nWe made reservations for 2 nonsmoking rooms. My family and I arrived early, we tried to check in at 1pm but was told by the staff at Guest Services that our rooms were not ready and to come back at in 2 hours. Fair enough. We walked around for 2 hours, my mom started to feel ill, we returned to the front desk at 3pm. We were again told the rooms were not ready. We informed the front desk that one of the members of our party is not feeling well and we want to know how much longer is the wait. We were told in a very unsympathetic tone \\\"I don't know. Come back in half an hour.\\\" We came back at 3:30 and was again told in a very monotone \\\"Your rooms are not ready.\\\" So when can we expect our rooms? I asked. \\\"I don't know. It's not ready yet.\\\" By this time, my mom was really feeling ill. The smoke in the casino was bothering her so she was literally sitting on the floor in the lobby. Which brings up another question, why are there no chairs or sitting area in your lobby? I guess that's because you want us to go and sit in the casino right? We again, informed the staff that someone is not feeling well. We have two rooms, can we check into one. We got a very unenthuastic \\\"Sure\\\". She found us a room. How long has that option been available? And then even more puzzling, she handled us one set of room keys and then a few seconds later, handed us another set of room keys. No explanation what-so-ever but apparently, we got both of our rooms. \\n\\nThe next day, I decided I wanted to speak to management about this. Certain family members tried to talk me out of it saying \\\"Don't bother, they have our money only. They don't care. We're not high-rollers.\\\" I thought about it but then thought it's not fair to you if we don't even give you the opportunity to make things better. So the next day, my sister and I went down to Guest Services and asked to speak with the manager who's on. We spoke with the manager. We told her what happened. She gave us a fake smile and without looking into anything said she can explain to us what happened. She states that they usually try to accomodate early check-ins but sometimes it's just not possible. I can understand that but wait, isn't the check-in time suppose to be 3pm? Apparently not, she said their check-in is at 4pm. Bellagio, MGM Grand, and many other hotels on the strip have a 3pm check-in time but at Paris it's 4pm. This was also information that we never received at the front desk. She also apparently didn't feel that our complaint of lack of communication with the front desk was justified. We were sent back and forth three times but she said rooms are constantly being turn-overed and said \\\"at a click of a button on the computer, things change... We might have no rooms available one second and then the next second we have tons of rooms all clean.\\\" The tone of the manager was condescending and patronizing. I was even more upset after talking to her than before. \\n\\nOkay, so maybe I shouldn't have said anything, I'll just write you a nasty yelp review. \\n\\nI can deal with you old and smelly rooms but I cannot deal with you snotty attitude. \\n\\nSo in conclusion, I am not coming back to this hotel again. There are better hotels on the Vegas strip. Apparently, the staff here thinks they are true Parisians.",

The hostess said that she couldn't guarantee a cabana, but she would make a note of it. This was pretty understandable to me considering the restaurant is busy, popular and diners like to lounge lagoon side for hours. We show up early for our reservation and I was told that a cabana was not open and that we would have to wait for one and she didn't know how long that would be. I agreed, and headed over to the bar to have drinks. The bartender was very nice and time flew while talking to him. He even named a drink after me!  After over an hour, we were finally seated at a cabana (at 10pm).\\n\\nSo down to business. The food was good, however whether or not it was worth the price is debatable. We dined on beef tartar, seared scallops, spaghetti all scoglio and the pan seared rib-eye. All in all, the food was good, but it wasn't amazing. Perhaps in order to experience amazing, we should have ordered the fresh \\\"flown in daily from the Mediterranean\\\" fish (which is $15 for every 3 oz, and I wasn't interested in spending $100 for a fish), or a tasting menu. However, I do expect VERY good for a restaurant like this, considering it s a Michelin rated restaurant. The best part of it was the dessert (and I rarely order dessert at any restaurant because I don't care for it much). They brought out a slice of cake (on the house) for my birthday and pistachio, coffee, and vanilla gelato. The gelato was probably the best I have had. It was perfect in texture, temperature and flavor. \\n\\nOn the upside, I enjoyed the service and the atmosphere was amazing. Bartolotta is great for celebrating a special event, such as a birthday or an anniversary. Be prepared to spend here, for the atmosphere, and definitely request a cabana. I'm not sure what it's like during the day time, but at night it's gorgeous and it really enhances the dining experience.",

I can count those who offer this in Laval with the fingers of my hand.\\n\\nSo off to the review, after 2 visits, had to make sure, see? *squints eyes*\\n\\nFirst visit was during a weekday lunch with a friend, no line-up at noon, got a \\\"banquet\\\" in a quiet corner and ordered the pulled pork burger, with side fries and 'apple' coleslaw. The burger was HUGE and more importantly, AMAZING. I've had pulled pork countless times in my life but this was probably the best pulled pork burger I've eaten in awhile, if not ever. Did I mention it was HUGE? I could barely pick the beast up and take it out of its fat misery.\\n\\nThe side fries were a bit disappointing and the 'apple' coleslaw didn't really taste like either apple nor coleslaw. It wasn't terrible but not for me. Either way, after the burger, I didn't have any more space.\\n\\nThe price tag was reasonable and the service very efficient. I got my meal within 10 minutes and my drink in 2 minutes. All in all a perfect 5 star experience.\\n\\nThe next visit was a few mere days later with wife and friends on a Saturday night. As I bought my infant with me, our visit was in mid-afternoon, before the possible Saturday night rush. We were placed in the back with similar families and children, a smart and efficient way the staff took care of business to segregate guests accordingly. As a new parent, the last thing I want to do is annoy other patrons and with similar patrons all on the same side of the restoraunt, the other patrons without children can be left in peace.\\n\\nThis time I went with the St-Louis ribs, my friend went with the Beef ribs and we decided to share them. The food arrived after 25 minutes and I got lucky enough to have the same waiter who provided once again more than adequate service. He was obviously rushed but he took care of us and got tipped handsomely (I hope he felt that way) for his efforts.\\n\\nAs a rib man, I like many types of ribs and know my ribs and the St-Louis ribs looked impressive when they arrived but someway, somehow, I felt neutral about them. Maybe it was the sauce or the fatty cut about them, I didn't particularly care for it. The Beef ribs were slightly better but still not my cup of tea.\\n\\nThis time I went with the side sweet potato fries ($2 surcharge) and the standard coleslaw. The sweet potato fries were exceptional and loved them. The coleslaw wasn't for me.\\n\\nWe ordered dessert (cheesecake) and a cappuccino and they were both very good. I hope they try to expand the selection of desserts in the future by 1-2.\\n\\nMy wife was disappointed the mac-n-cheese burger wasn't available and went with the normal burger which she found decent but nothing to write home about.\\n\\nAll in all, a good experience.\\n\\nWill be back.",

'09 and they had this special where locals get half off the price. Like for locals per person would only be $7 but for tourist would be $14. So we waited for 1hour and 30 minutes in line. when we were almost there the line split to two. they had one line for locals and one line for tourist. So we couldn't see that little sign that was being blocked by the crowd so we just went to any line. The couple infront of us was locals also so since we couldn't see what was going on and nobody was there to assist us. We just followed the couples infront of us. When we went to go pay on this machine and we put our zipcode. We found out that we was on the wrong line and the only choice we had was to pay the full price. So before we got seated we told the waiter and another employee and they all said that they can't do anything about it. I asked to speak to the manager and they said that she was not available and they refused to let us talk to her. THAT WAS THE FIRST RESTAURANT I EVER GONE TO IN LAS VEGAS THAT SAID THEY CAN'T REFUND YOUR MONEY, GIVE YOU THE PROMOTION AND SAID THAT THE MANAGER WAS UNAVAILABLE. We had family over from Sacramento so unfortunately we ended up paying over $200 total which means we lost $60.  We couldn't do anything about it. I'm pretty sure they were LAZY and IT WAS SO BUSY that they didn't even CARE to try to do anything about it. So we had no choice but to make it worth it. But yeah right! the waiter was rude and we had to look for him and go up to him to ask to take our plates and give us a refill. HORRIBLE. My family and I are never eating here again. Which makes this restaurant lose 3 stars from me.",

I like that Costco carries some pretty cool items like paper shredders (yes..flashback to Modern Family Season 1).  We bought a great shredder here and might I say we have prevented identity theft thus far :) Costco has a great price on their organic spinach boxes, their wine and alcohol selection and pricing is decent and they have some items I use like Boursin cheese, Fage yogurt etc at decent prices.  Oh, most of all their environmentally friendly Kirkland detergent is really the bomb, That's really the reason I keep my cousin's Costco card in my wallet.\\n\\nNow from my gripes:\\n\\nI get seriously irritated when I see severely obese people buying industrial sized packages of full fat cheese, trays of butter croissants and bulk bags of chocolates. I don't think anyone needs that much food unless they are feeding a very unhealthy school. Costcos are full of such irresponsible behavior. But I guess it's a personal choice on what you consume but hey, I'm paying part of their medical bills with my hefty taxes! Before I digress too much...back to the issue at hand...\\n\\nThis Costco is ridiculously busy at all times of the day and the lines are crazy. So for someone like me who's buying detergent, it's about a 45 minute process to find parking, walk to the detergent aisle and check out. \\n\\nGenerally, I can't get behind the idea of Costco because I would never purchase 4 watermelons at a go or a gallon tub of potato salad. Buying what I need from Trader Joe's/Sunflower is plenty for me and it affords me variety in my daily meals since I don't have to (let's say)use up a giant bag of dumplings.\\n\\nYes, I patronize Costco once every 6 months or so but I don't think I'll ever be getting a membership or crying my eyes out if they happen to disappear.",

They'll also make-to-order for your privilege.  \\n\\nMy first visit, I got to try the three meat dishes: jerk chicken, curry goat, oxtail stew.\\nAll were tasty, but I was partial to the chicken.  It's made mild and offered with much hotter jerk sauce if that's your pleasure.  The steamed veggies tasted good as well and the plantains were delicious.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, the dessert wasn't like anything I've tasted before and struck out  unpleasantly.   Won't ever ask for dessert again.\\n\\nJerk chicken - 1\\nDessert - 0\\n\\nMy second visit, I got to the fish: steamed snapper, fried tilapia.  Both were decent dishes.  The snapper was a whole fish made to order and cost \\\"market price,\\\" the tilapia was prix fixe and served as small lightly breaded filets.  \\n\\nI also requested a veggie stew which the cook made fresh from carrots, cabbage, and coconut milk.  It was creamy, perfectly spicy (not burning), and tasted wonderful.  Home run.\\n\\nTilapia - 1\\nVeggie stew - 1\\n\\nThe price wasn't so wonderful though.  I asked to substitute stewed veggies for the prepared steamed veggie side.  Nope - apparently we were on different menus, I was later told that the stew is a separate dish.  So I gave up $20 for the tilapia and veggie stew.  It's all right though, I made two meals out that portion.  Leftovers were even more yummy the next day.\\n\\nLesson noted: get a price quote before making substitutions.  The guy behind the counter will say, \\\"I'll take care of it\\\" and by the time he's rung up your bill, you're like - HOW MUCH?!\\n\\nFood on the third visit to Jerk Hut Jamaican Grille was not good at all.  I noticed a different cook and was hesitant, but I manned-up and ordered take out anyway.  Veggie stew and plantains please.  \\n\\nI was given extra plantain wedges this time which would usually make me jump for joy, because the fruit is one of my fave foods.  But when I got home, one bite in and, yuck.  Those wedges were soggy, greasy, gelatinous things.  \\n\\nIt seems they had used sweet ripe plantains and overcooked them.  (In my opinion, sweet ripe plantains should be baked, leave the frying for the unripe starchy ones.)  Like any other food that's overcooked, the plantains grew less and less appealing every minute they sat in the warmer.  I did not eat them.\\n\\nOn to the stew.  First look - the carrots and cabbage were covered in clumps of butter and coconut milk and I couldn't even bite into it yet.  It took a couple of rinses under the tap to get the clumps out, but so went a lot of the flavor too.  \\n\\nPlantains - 0   \\nVeggie Stew - 0",

I was in shock that they had the nerve to send me the violation with an attached photo of the one poop in the yard. If that's not harassment then I don't know what is...oh I know having them send me that same violation every three weeks. Really dogs poop I pick it up and guess what digs will poop some more its ridiculous.  Now they have moved on however from the poop violations. Now for some reason they don't have my approval for my security camera I installed because kids were jumping into my yard, were throwing rocks at my dogs and sliding glass door.  They were throwing their chip bags over trying to feed my dogs and damaged my brick wall, which I was told I had to fix.  Well its been nine months and all of a sudden now its not approved...we don't have your paperwork. Ok so did they lose it, misplace it or did they just throw it away so they could have one more thing to harass me about. And if I fill it out again which I probably wouldn't have had such a problem with, if I don't know that idiot assistant knew how to talk to people with respect. Will the paperwork be \\\"missing\\\" again in a few months and they make me fill it out again.

On my street only three lights work its so dark so unsafe. They decided to change security gaurd companies damn guy sits in the club house all day. Just as hard as they work at harrasing me they should work at keeping tabs on the security gaurd company they hired. A dog was killed across from my house two sundays ago by a vicious pitt bull. I have nothing against the breed but according to the hoa when I moved in here that type of breed was not allowed. So I don't understand why nothing was said to my neighbors, why am I the only one being harassed. If they did their jobs properly and stopped focusing all their efforts on my one piece of poop in my yard maybe they could have saved poor cocos life. Not to mention a little girl was walking coco and that pitt got out somehow, she was lucky coco was the target of the attack and she was able to run off. Who knows what could have happened to that poor little girl if the pitt had turned on her. Its just irritating to me that real problems exist but all they want to do is harass me!!!! Oh and did I mention a fire hydrant is tipped over broken. How many times must I send them complaints. What's going to happen if a fire occurs and the firefighters can't use the hydrant to extinguish the fire.

I was sorely disappointed.\\n\\nWe went over the memorial day weekend so it ended up costing a little over $40 plus tax per person. I wouldn't have minded the price, but the food was very sorely lacking.\\n\\nUltimately buffets are about the variety of the food and, in this case, the quality. \\n\\nThe good:\\nBeautiful desserts, lovely presentation. gelato, fresh macaroons, cookies, marshmallows, cheese cake, etc. Modern decor, attentive wait staff. Good lemonade and orange juice. \\n\\nThe bad: \\nValue/Uniqueness -Nothing out of the ordinary. Far too expensive for what you get. I would not pay more than $25 for this stuff--even for Vegas.We came for bruch and the selection was very sub par and unremarkable. Pancakes, fresh toast, omellete station, breads, 2-3 cheeses), cereal and fruit. Nothing worth $40. They didn't have a belgian waffle section, or  any out of the ordinary breakfast offering. Very sparse and a major disappointment...and I LOVE breakfast food. \\n\\nVariety - The lunch food selection is what really upset me. My fiance is big on meats and there were hardly any meats there (lamb, pork ribs, and tri tip), poor selection of salads, vegetable options, and general main dishes. I felt like I was eating a bunch of side dishes and fillers (i.e., mac n' cheese -not that great, risotto, pizza, spaghetti--seriously?), A big beef was that  their sushi  was no better than what you can get at the market--not fresh, dried out, flavorless. On top of that, the little Asian foods they had were also inedible. \\n\\nI really wanted to love Wicked Spoon. It had so much potential and had really great reviews. I am guessing most of these people were just there for the dessert, cause that's all I saw that was worth eating.  It just really let me down. I'm sorry, my fiance gave this place a shot for me cause he knows I like pretty food, but I really owe him a buffet at the Bellagio. Wicked Spoon, you really let me down. It's embarassing. We couldn't even enjoy our food. I even lost my appetite because the food was so bad. Considering it was Memorial Day weekend, I can't imagine what disappointing menu they normally would have for a cheaper price. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. If you don't mind shelling out 35-40 for cute little desserts then go ahead, but otherwise I'd skip this place and do the Bellagio buffet instead.",

As expected, a large crowd had gathered at the entrance and it all came down to who you were with and how much you were willing to spend on the next bottle or two. We ended up with a booth in the house room and the vibe was exactly how I imagined it. Intimate with a shot of adrenaline....the way I like it! There were the obvious house music lovers then I was told of a hiphop room which was an extra $20 or 30 to get in!?!?! (minus one star for that BS).  Once we had settled in, it was time to hit the dance floor! Nothing like a house showcase or battle to start things off.  It was insane :)  We hung out until the early or late hours of the morning (next day).  It was definitely past 7am since we felt like vampires when the sun smacked us in the face but was it worth it?

Part of what confuses me is with use of the letter \\\"K\\\" in the name.  What is the purpose of that?  Whimmsey?  Whatever.  At least it is not named after a Karen.  That would make for an awkward set of initials.  Anyhow, second point of confusion, the decor.  There was a patchwork of table, chairs, and booths.  All looked as though they came from several other restaurants.  The chair I was in looked familiar.  My thought was L&L Hawaiin BBQ.  The table was reminiscent of Aloha Kitchen.  Some chairs looked like bamboo and had arm rests.  Other chairs did not.  Did the owners go to some surplus sale and buy what they could?  I don't know.\\n\\nMore important than the atmosphere is the food.  I got a lot of food for $9.99.  A Philly Skillet consisting of home fries topped with chopped beef steak, onion, bell pepper, three scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese.  On the side was two biscuits with gravy.  I was full when I left.  Satisfied though?  Eh.  The potatoes were oviously boiled before they were placed on the griddle.  Home fries are supposed to be browned and somewhat crunchy.  Not soggy.  The steak had a great flavor.  No complaints there.  The menu stated mushrooms were included in this dish.  There were no mushrooms.  Additionally, bell peppers were not mentioned yet had a supporting role.  This was acceptable but I really do like mushrooms.  So Mollie's gets docked points there.  As for the biscuits and gravy.  I've had better.  Heck, I've made better.  The biscuits were small and lacked the fluff I like in a good biscuit.  The gravy had no sausage as a good country gravy should.  It was more of a warm paste seasoned heavily with black pepper.  I hate to say it because I like to support little one-off places like this, but I prefer to go to Denny's for breakfast.\\n\\nThe service was good and quick.  I have to give them that.",

We will definitely be back.  The food was well thought out and prepared to perfection.\\n\\nI started out with the Oysters on the half shell which were great.  The oysters themselves were perfect which I get that the restaurant just really shucks them and puts them on ice but were a great start to a meal.  Prior to the oysters they brought out 2 \\\"pre appetizers\\\" made special by the Chef to entice our appetite.  We had a salmon paste type plate....very small but just enough to wake up the ol tastebuds.  We then had some sort of risotto, ham and the ever popular chantrelle mushroom small plate that was just bursting with perfection.\\n\\nMy Co-Diners had the Yellowfin Tuna Spring Rolls which has now taken over as the Best App in Charlotte IMO.  Sushi grade tuna, jalapeno, cucumber and a sprig of cilantro to pull it all together.  What a great combination of flavor.  Also, I was able to sample the Grilled Peach Salad.  Surprisingly fresh Georgia Peaches, Mascarpone cheese which really stood out, basil, honey and I'm still not sure what the heck \\\"Mache\\\" is but I do know that I like it.  \\n\\nFor my entree I had the special NY Strip.  14 glorious oz of perfectly cooked NY Strippy goodness.  It was marinated perfectly with worchestershire and seasoned to perfection.  It had a cippolini onion chutney which when paired together made me start thinking about when I was coming back.  \\n\\nWe finished up with a few desserts for the table.  I am not sure who the Master Dessert Chef they have in the back but give him/her a raise!  This person is a genious.  Banana Cream Pie which had like 6 layers or something.  It was nothing short of exemplary and included banana bread, banana pudding, and shaved chocolate.  I could have eaten that as my meal.  WOW.\\n\\nSuffice it to say the service was also impeccable.

My first instinct is to to try to get a number to wait for a table as that's the usual routine in most Chinese restaurant.  It took me a while to locate this on woman who seemed to be the boss and I asked her for a number.  She then asked me to wait outside as she was busy doing something else.  More people have walked in and everyone was waiting to get a number from this woman.  When she finally had time to do that, she had no idea which customer was first.  I then got a number and was told that the waiting time would be at least 30 minutes.  She pretty much told everyone else the same thing.  We decided to leave and went to restaurant next door.  We noticed very soon that the crowd has disappeared very quickly as many people did not want to wait neither\\n\\nThe next day we went back a little earlier for breakfast as they are the  only restaurant that offer soy milk and the green onion pancake and some other kinds of dim sum.  We were told the same thing that the waiting time would be at least 30 minutes despite the fact that there was not such a big crowd.  That same woman kept telling everyone to wait outside of the restaurant and many people left just like yesterday. We decided to wait and in less than 10 minutes, we were seated.  That same woman who was in charge of handing out numbers to people came and gave us the breakfast menu.  She told us that we have to order everything at one time and they will not allow customers to order anything after the initial order.  That seems to be strangest rule in any restaurant.  One of the dish that we ordered was steamed buns and when it got to our table, the buns were cold.  Not lukewarm but cold.  I then took the dish and showed it to a waitress. (It was impossible to get any waiter to come to your table and if you are lucky enough to get one, they will not remember what you asked for and you will keep waiting for nothing.)  I told the waitress that the buns are cold.  Instead of taking the dish back to the kitchen and get it fixed, her first response was, 'Do you want it then?'  So I said no despite the fact that it was the one thing my five-year old son would eat.  We then simply tried to finish the meal and get out of there.  We asked for the check and was told that you had to walk to the front to pay.  When I got the bill, the 15% tip was already included in the total of the entire bill.  I asked then whether this is something that Las Vegas restaurant does.  The guy then just took the bill away and immediately gave me another one without the tip added and left a blank line of the tip amount.  I then asked for some change as I wanted to give him the exact amount and he refused to give it to me.  I decided at that point that this restaurant does not deserve a single dime of tip.  \\n\\nThe fact that there was a big crowd often was because there was no competition in that area for that kind of food.  They are getting away with the worst service and I am shocked to see how that woman treated the customers when they first walked in.  She is basically driving customers away.  When was the last time you go to a restaurant that will only allow you to order one time????",

The windowsills are dusty. The salsa bar is in need of more ice and a good wipe down. The soda machine is a sticky mess and dusty on top as well. If the place is open 24hours, there should be some down time to clean the store.

The Surrender staff will put 2 bottle table and cabana reservations in a line and make you wait (just like the $40 entry line) unless you agree to buy additional bottles. Incidentally, we were guests of the Wynn Tower suites and the reservation was made by the Wynn concierge and they still didn't honor it.\\n\\n2.  Your reservation is not good after 10:30.  Even if your host agrees to 11:30 as the time for your party's arrival, they do not hold reservations and continue to sell all tables and cabanas, even the one you \\\"reserved\\\".  Yes, even if you're a guest of the Wynn, even if they have your CC on file -- they will sell your table if it's a busy night.  If you do not arrive by 10:30 pm, your reservation may not be good.  \\n\\n3.  The \\\"Handshake\\\" means nothing other than \\\"You're an idiot\\\".  All of the hosts have their hands out for handshakes filled with cash.  Table / Cabana handshakes cost between $200 - 400 dollars depending on the size of your group).  Without a handshake, you will not move through their artificially created lines and even with a handshake, if they sold your table, you will be sitting at the restaurant.\\n\\nTHE DETAILS\\n\\nAs a guest of Tower Suites, the Wynn's hotel within the hotel, you have access to private concierges who were fantastic and promptly put us in touch with a host that reserved a cabana for our group of 6 for $1,000.  \\n\\nWe arrived at Surrender at the time agreed in writing with our host, 11pm.  We were placed in a line and told that we essentially wouldn't be getting in unless we agreed to an additional bottle, so $1,500.  We were told that this was a discount and we in fact overheard them telling everyone else that wanted a table that the price was 6 bottles ($3,000).\\n\\nEven after agreeing to the $1,500, we were still forced to wait an additional 20 minutes until we provide a handshake.  After all of this, we were escorted to a breakfast table at the poolside restaurant attached to the Beach Club, nowhere near the action.  \\n\\nIt was only once agreeing to the extra bottle, only after agreeing to pay the host a handshake, only after waiting in line 45 minutes that we finally got in to discover that they'd sold our cabana and our group of 6 would have to spend $1,500 to sit at a table for 4 where they'd be serving hash browns  in less than 6 hours.  \\n\\nNeedless to say we turned the table down and left.  The club is beautiful to look at and the Wynn/Encore is the nicest experience in Vegas, hands down.  But the staff at their nightclubs are the industry's worst.  They have no respect for their customers and do not honor reservations.  \\n\\nI would recommend staying at the Wynn without hesitation, but find somewhere else to go on club night.\\n\\nInterestingly, the head of the Wynn's nightclub group was arrested on a DUI charge with Paris Hilton on the Friday night we were there.  So, if you're curious why our incident happened, just think about this:\\n\\nCy Waits was promoted to head of XS/Surrender less than a week ago.  Less than a week after getting what many consider the #1 nightclub job in the world, instead of running the nearly $150 million facilities, he's driving around the strip smoking weed, doing coke and getting arrested.  Is there any wonder why the clubs are mismanaged?",

Slightly salty, sweet, and an incredibly soft texture - divine.  \\n\\n\\nPrior to ordering, I loved that the waiter rolled out several variations of the raw cut beef to demonstrate the difference in Kobe Wagyu & American style Wagyu (mixed with Angus to give it a meatier texture).  \\nMy entree was the Petit Filet Mignon (USDA Illinois) served with the Argentinian chimichirri sauce, a light and springy taste with shallots, garlic, and cilantro.  Perfectly cooked at medium and absolutely delicious.  Refrain from biting the screen:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/J4CATH00YZrq8Bne2S4_cw?select=YXCIjyzzVH7Cb9vr-cifGg \\nThe fiance also loved his American wagyu rib-eye with kosho butter sauce.  While part of the meat was slightly tough, the thicker end of the rib-eye melted in my mouth.  It's not necessary to order an additional sauce with your meat, since they also bring out three condiments for you to use anyhow.  \\n\\nI do recommend sharing the sides family style with a group - at about $12/side, you get a significant amount of delicious fare.  Our group of four split three sides: the delicious creamy Mac & Cheese with Quebec cheddar, the sauteed wild field mushrooms, and the butternut squash.  All were incredibly savory!  The best and most amusing part of the dinner was that we had three waiters (one per side dish) hovering next to us individually to explain what the dish was and proceeded to scoop it onto our plate before shuffling to the next person - it felt like culinary musical chairs.  If fighting over equal portions of a dish is an issue, this eliminates that problem...\\n\\nAmbiance is very modern and sleek.  It is pretty dim, but it wasn't too bothersome for us.  Similar to the sauce, ordering dessert isn't necessary since they brought out a plate with decadent filled chocolates.  An exquisite way to end a satisfying and indulgent meal.",

After walking the strip for the past few hours  we kept smelling that damned BBQ so naturally with us being from the south (ATL shawty lol) we opted to eat here and get our 'grub' on.\\n\\nWe chose to sit inside because the restaurant sits literally BTW the boat at T.I. and the boardwalk where everyone walks and I am not a fan of putting on a show while eating. \\n\\nThe guys ordered a pitcher of beer and the girls got either soda or water. I'm assuming the server was new bc it took him forever to bring our drinks (not beer bc I understand that comes from the bar, but 10 min for water and fountain drinks for 4 people in a slow restaurant is not a good look). The bartender ended up taking our orders and waiting on us for the remainder of the meal. I can't recall what everyone else ordered but I think one of the meals might have either been quesadilla (i can never spell that right) or sliders. But 2 of us ordered the short ribs, including myself and man-o-man was that good. \\n\\nThe Shot rib (rib because it was only one, and had I not have had two sides I may have been a little pissed off) was prepared the right way, whichever way that may actually be, but the meat fell off the bone! They had variations of sauces at the table people could choose, don't remember the flavors all to well but they were what I would expect from a west coast Vegas-y restaurant, and with my expectations not being set too high for the sauces to blow my mind, I was pleased. My side dishes consisted of baked beans and mac & cheese. Again, my southern roots didn't sway me to expect them to be like moms homemade dishes, I was fairly pleased with them. I give the place a B- simply because I love BBQ and that particular day we hadn't eaten except maybe once and had walked from PH to the N & S parts of the strip all day so maybe my stomach appreciated the meal more than my taste buds.\\n\\nThe server/bartender whom we saw all of 3 maybe 4 times got the minimum tip from us bc she wasn't as attentive as she could have been esp with it not being crowded at all. And had this not have been Vegas they might not have gotten anything.\\n\\nThe meals are not cheap, but then again what is 'cheap' in Vegas. Even the McDonalds isn't cheap, but one should expect to spend $$$ when you come here for leisure otherwise, why come right? All in all, I would come again if I have the urge for BBQ. I won't expect the best service, they just better be sure to have my food right.",

For my meal I ordered the chicken and poblano cheese crisp as it was also on the happy hour menu and I fancy myself a frugal individual, haha. It was really good once I picked off the chunks of raw onion and black olives that were scattered on top, I suppose it was my bad for assuming that it would only have chicken and poblanos, as that is the title of the dish. The cream sauce that was drizzled on was delicious. For my husband, who is less frugal, he ordered the chicken skewers for his appetizer and they were amazing! They were so juicy and the glaze was sweet and mildly spicy. Then for his 'entree' he ordered the salmon salad. It was highly disappointing for a 15 dollar salad. It was a mix of fresh greens, a handful of avocado, and a burnt fillet of salmon resting on top. I think that he would have been happier if he had ordered a second helping of the chicken skewers.

Let me quote Animaniacs and say  \\\"Helloooooooooo Nurse!\\\" \\n\\nFrom the get go they tell you that eating here is not good for your health. It says it on the front of the door. It's like a cactus with spikes pointed out just telling you \\\"This will hurt if you touch it!\\\" But hell, who doesn't want a hamburger named after a medical procedure\\n\\nYou walk in and the place is set up like a huge bar made out of a giant red cross logo in the middle. Inside of which the dressed in nurse gear servers take your order while sports play on television. This place is delightfully tacky. \\n\\nburgers vary and a bypass is considered a half pound patty. So there's a single bypass, double bypass, triple bypass and quadruple bypass. You get the deal. They have fries that are cooked with lard. Sounds healthy, right?\\n\\nIt wasn't till about half way into the meal that I realized that the inner red cross symbol of a counter had mirrors that were angled up. This caught me off guard, like - wait, why am I looking up skirts while enjoying a burger? But sure enough they're there on purpose to give you a better view of the underwear of the waitresses. Oh man, that's when the misogyny was in full bloom, right? \\n\\nBefore feeling like a tool of the Patriarchy I looked over at the margarita bar and there was two couples that had to be in their 70's or early 80's. All of them eating the single bypass. And I really just thought to myself that this place couldn't be so bad if they are able to attract those elderly people here. \\n\\nEither that or I need to rethink what I know about the elderly. This may be a case of Benny Hill syndrome and I'm just not hearing the Yakity Sax playing in the background.\\n\\nDuring the course of the meal they also had someone weigh in at the proper 350 pounds and surly enough, he got his food for free and the people in the place were screaming and egging him on. \\n\\nI would like to think that while they encourage you to let it all go. In fact making it so that if you suffer from Systemic and Diabetic II levels, you get your meal for free, that there's some sort of life lesson to be learned here.\\n\\nMaybe coming here and getting put center stage causes you to re-evaluate your weight problems. after your gluttonous burger and up-skirt adventure you'll change your ways.. \\n\\nSo how was the food? The burger was really juicy for being a massive pound and a half of meat between the burns. \\n\\nIt has a salad bar of condiments. So they pretty much give you the burger with bread and meat. You put the tomatoes and lettuce on it. I imagine they wouldn't want to encourage eating veggies. It would ruin their street cred. \\n\\nThey have real bottled sodas here, so that's a plus. Over all, if you can get past the whole idea that they're encouraging obesity (Well, not really - just being honest about their food) and move past the fact that you have short skirt wearing servers, then it's a stop worthy venture to come out to the Heart Attack Grill.",

He said it was a little confusing and no one offered to help until he asked.

Lol.\\n\\nOne thing I don't get is how they come up with the pricing. I guess if it is only premium ingredients they need to jack up the price... but it seems kind of sad to pay 3.25 for a cupcake when you can buy a box for 1.00 and make 24.... lol.

I read the production policy and it states that the order could be expected 7-10 business days after it is placed. My friends birthday is October 3rd which is 10 days after I placed the order. Since it falls on a Friday I did the calculations and Fabness should have the canvas to me by that date. As a precaution, I followed up with them on Monday, September 29th to make sure the order was going to ship soon. In addition, their email confirmation sent to me when I placed the order says that it should take 5-7 business days for the order to be completed PLUS an extra 3 days for it to ship on the west coast. I'm located in San Diego, so this is obviously on the west coast. This means my canvas should be here by 10 business days.\\nI received a response from Fabness on September 30th stating that my canvas is \\\"still in processing\\\" and that the service agent \\\"does not think I will get my canvas by 10/3/2014 (my friends birthday).\\\" She also said \\\"you would have had to select 3 day shipping when you placed the order to get it rushed through in production in time.\\\" Even though I thoroughly read the policy, which states 3 day shipping on the west coast, apparently Fabness has taught their customer service reps to be dishonest with their customers in order to lengthen the time and blame their customer.\\nThe response from Fabness does not recognize what what the email confirmation said OR what the order conditions (5 - 10 business days) on their website promised. It was clear that the order could take up to 10 business days but not any longer. I am extremely disappointed in this company and their turn-around time and I would NEVER recommend them to anyone. There is an abundance of companies on Groupon and online with canvas and printing services that I have ordered canvases through. They have arrived in no later than 5 days. I'm writing this as a warning to consumers that if you place an order through them - know that it will arrive MUCH later than their policy and your expectations.",

It was pretty prompt and the lady was quite nice. \\n\\nOverall, I'd probably give this place another go. Maybe for something quick or maybe to try their famous chocolate drizzled churro. If you're looking for Mexican food or some type of Mex fusion, I'd go somewhere else...",

My eagle eye beau was certain that the pours varied wildly...c'est la vie for a reasonable glass. Nice of the local distributor rep to yell (no, not yelp) out the true price of their wine selection.

The puss face, nasty toned lady on the food side - smiling is free and so is preparing an order THE WAY IT'S ORDERED. To the owner- these two people are hurting your business and I will never return to your establishment.  \\n\\nI have been here many many times before tonight. I live steps away from Zetouni and I like different items on the menu from each. The staff at zetouni is pleasant, attentive and efficient. \\n\\nThere were 2 tables of 2 when I came in. The teenager working doesn't say hello, doesn't look up at you. As she's looking at her phone says \\\"what do you want to order\\\". RUDE. I ordered one of the specials for the night. Gyro sandwich and SALAD. Fine. Seems easy enough for a Greek restaurant no? I nicely asked for extra tomatoes and onions. The nasty lady behind the counter gave me a dirty look as soon as she heard it. Fine. \\n\\n10 mins go by as I watch the child working stomp her feet around the restaurant in her leggings and Tshirt - very professional. My food is ready and again, without looking up, \\\"utensils?\\\"  I reply \\\"no thank you, may I have some tatziki sauce on the side. The nasty one in the back chimes in \\\"that'll be 70 cents\\\". The child proceeds to turn to me and for the first time actually looks me in the eye \\\"it's 70 cents\\\". The lady in the back will not hand her the sauce yet. Fine. \\n\\nI only had a debit card on me so that's what I handed her. SEVENTY CENTS. she swiped my card for seventy cents. Good luck with that credit card processing fee owner!!! I have NEVER in my life seen anything like this. She slaps the receipt and my card on the counter, nasty in the back hands her the sauce. She puts it on the counter and walks away. \\n\\nI am really not a difficult customer nor do I expect anything I don't pay for or deserve. That being said WHEN I ORDER AND PAY FOR SALAD IT'S MIND BLOWING THAT I GET HOME TO FREAKING FRENCH FRIES. ?????\\n\\nWhat gives here? It's a shame because the food is actually good. Which is why I gave the extra star but after my experience today- whether they care or not - they have lost me as a customer. \\n\\nIt really is too bad because there used to be a very sweet lady running the counter who couldn't have been nicer. \\n\\nI don't need to drive out of my way to be treated like a second class citizen bothering nasty people who are being PAID to be there and provide customer service. \\n\\nWill not ever go or recommend again. Your loss. No thank you. Hope your seventy cents came in handy.",

Bottled OJ at a price that they charged is so wrong. 1/5\\n\\nI am still pretty shocked that I was expecting a better meal but I ended up with a bland and dry one.

When I go eat Thai food I expect - and really want - to be slapped  in the face with a giant hammer of flavor. I need to feel the pain! The spices! The flavor assaulting my very core from every angle. Not so much here... Very bland flavors that left me without any sort of teary eyes, runny nose or deep satisfaction when delicate balance meets raw power - which is usually the staple of great Thai food. The dishes should punch your guts in but gently, and politely. It usually brings along friends to accompany the spiciness. Here I got a long highway paved with pillows and elevator music.\\n\\nBlandness.\\n\\nNo depth, no balance, not enough flavors. Yea you feel spiciness but that is never enough on its own.\\n\\nWe had 5 dishes and they ranged from being just weirdly put together like their cucumber salad with a sweet cough-like-syrup to being OK like their tofu with red curry. The spring rolls were under-seasoned which to me takes out a few stars right from the get go. The sauce was quite poorly made - I could do better and I am terrible in the kitchen.

I say I went because showing up is the ONLY way to get service. Phones not answered. Vmails and Emails not returned. I drive all the way there to schedule an appointment for a recommended Oil Change, Transmission Fluid Flush, Brake Fluid Flush, 4 spark plugs, and it turns out I need new brake pads and rotors so I agree...$1100 which I am happy to pay for great car service. I pick up the car and a couple of days later there's a foul smell coming form the engine AND an oil slick in my garage. Transmission fluid leak. I call to get Derek to help BUT no phone, vmail or email answered so I drive over, in a different car. Derek tells me to bring it in, looks at it and finds that a seal failed. He replaces it and we're all good BUT there's fluid all over the under-carriage. He pulls out a pressure washer to clean my car but that's not working either so he dabs it with paper towels. Car stinks for a couple of days and we're good. I ask him if I need more fluid since a lot has gushed out and he says no. So I ask him if it was overfilled in the first place, only makes sense right? He says no, go figure...While I'm there I tell him that my brake pedal is REALLY low, especially given that I now have brand new brakes all around AND new brake fluid. He tells me that Audi brake pedals that go virtually to the floor before braking is \\\"normal\\\". Anyone who has ever driven a car knows that's not normal but I just want out at this point. I go to a tire shop to buy new tires a few days later and ask them about the brakes and in 5 minutes they tell me my master brake cylinder needs to be replaced. They replace it and brakes are fine, pedal is nice and high and firm. The tire shop tells me they also replaced my brake pads because the ones in place were the wrong part # and were moving around in the caliper causing a noisy and possibly dangerous situation. Unbelievable, Derek installed the wrong brake pads on my car!!!\\n\\nSo I give Derek at Exklusiv $1100 for Transmission, Oil change and brakes and he royally screws up 2 out of 3. I figure $1100 is a lot for an oil change so I go and check my oil just for fun. As I pull on the plastic ring of the dipstick to pull it out it comes without the dipstick. Yep he also broke my dipstick and glued it back together with cheap glue. So now I have to spend $40 for a new Audi dipstick.\\n\\nRecap: Bad/zero communication - Oil leak - Oil mess - lying about brake pedal feel - missing broken master cylinder - wrong brake pads - broken dipstick.\\nIf you still want to take a chance on this place good luck getting hold of anyone to get an appointment!",

I've had more experience than most as my last dog had a form of hepatitis and was in and out of animal hospitals and veterinarians offices much of his life. Some vets view your animals as nothing but a dollar sign. It's sad to say but there are those that will order unnecessary tests and charge up your bill to kingdom come if they know that you are one of \\\"those\\\" that would pay whatever it costs to keep your little baby alive and well. Unconscionable and sick that anyone would put a poor and defenseless animal through additional pain and discomfort just to make an extra buck but it's actually more common than you'd think! I know that I've dealt with more than a few of those in the past. At Aloha Animal Hospital, it's not like that. \\n\\nI brought my dogs in for a teeth cleaning because I've heard that you are supposed to get your dogs teeth cleaned yearly. The vet checked out both of my dogs teeth and said they're ok and they didn't need it yet. Any other vet would have been scheduling an appointment for that immediately so they could make that money. And that's messed up! I actually hate doing the teeth cleanings because in order to give your dog proper dental care, you need to put them under anesthesia. That's a risk that you shouldn't be taken unless it is entirely necessary. By the way, they use human grade anesthesia here which is better tolerated by animals. It's more expensive but I'm not looking to cut corners when it comes to my dogs health. \\n\\nSo yeah, I trust Aloha Animal Hospital, a trust that is not given freely given because of all the problems I've had with scammer vets out to make a buck off the pain and misery of my dog in the past. \\n\\nTo show my great appreciation for their honesty and humane treatment of my little ones, I recommend them to all of my friends. Everyone that I have sent here has been happy. Not to mention the many smiles they have brought to my face when I see the pictures of my little ones in the back room dressed up like a bumble bee, an elf, hula dancer etc. As an extra special touch, Aloha Animal Hospital sends picture postcards to remind you of upcoming shots or checkups. The people that work here are on it! \\n\\nAlso, everyone that works really loves animals. You can just tell by the way they treat your pets. Dogs, cats, rabbits, ferrets, reptiles, guinea pigs, whatever animal you have... you can entrust their health needs with Aloha. Bring em here. I promise that you won't regret it! \\n\\nPlus, that chocolate with caramel and macadamia nut treat they leave in the room for the owners sweetened the deal for me too. I'm not gonna lie! Most owners like treats just as much as our pets do. Mahalo! :)",

This is my least favorite lunch stop I've ever been to downtown. \\n\\nIt's usually suggested by someone in the office who just wants a red sandwich meat sandwich and wants it fast. Then the rest of us have to suffer too. \\n\\nVery typical sandwiches like turkey, roast beef, etc, etc. I might like the place better if I ate alot of red meat. The people I go with swear that the \\\"Traffic Jam\\\" sandwich (a cluster fuck of different red sandwich meats) makes it worth the trip. The toppings are very pedestrian and limited. They will charge you to put something \\\"fancy\\\" like black olives on it.\\n\\nI would also challenge the \\\"clean\\\" assertion made by another reviewer. Although they have a ton of employees to run a pretty tight ship in terms of making sandwiches quick and cleaning up, we have had several incidents of finding questionable or disgusting items in the food we've ordered so as to make many  people in my office never want to go back.\\n\\nI give them one star for making a decent sandwich that I could've made just as easily at home and for cheaper. The second star is for their milkshakes which are made with real ice cream in front of you and are pretty good. Go to Sacks, duck and decanter, downtown deli, or one of dozens other downtown sandwich places first before here.",

I write this review to warn others and to try and spare you the headaches that we have experienced.  You are welcome to contact me with any questions and I am happy to share any documentation you would care to see.\\n\\nSo here is what happened:\\n\\nWe had Troy Lowe, Field Supervisor and the sales guy out to look at some windows for replacement on a home we had purchased.  Our first experience was good, we got a good price and they were able to provide us with the custom windows we wanted.  \\n\\nWe decided to move forward and Troy was scheduled to come back out and remeasure the windows just to make sure everything was right before fabrication.  Troy never showed.  Instead, we were assured that they had what they needed.  About two weeks later we got a call that our windows were in.  We scheduled installation.  \\n\\nThe windows were installed on November 10th.  The crew was polite, helpful and careful around our newly installed landscaping.  During installation a problem arose.  The windows, while custom made, were not the proper depth.  After installation, there was a 1/2\\\" to 5/8\\\" gap all the way around each of the windows.  A 1/4\\\" or less is standard.  I had three construction guys out to take a look, including a licensed general contractor and every one told us that the window were either measured wrong, made wrong or installed wrong - the gap was too big to caulk and would need drywall and joint compound.  \\n\\nWe called True View on the 11th and talked to our customer service rep, Rebecca, to let then know about our concerns and to work with them to get it resolved.  Rebecca assured us that our happiness and customer satisfaction was paramount to the company.  We assured Rebecca that we were happy to work with them to achieve a solution that worked for both sides.  If we could find a way to fix the gap on the inside we were fine to keep the windows. We understand the cost of re-fabricating the windows and our goal was not to put a local business out of business.  \\n\\nThe four weeks that followed have been a trial of patience, rudeness, lies and excuses from Troy and True View Windows and Glass.  We have been completely renovating a house for 14 months and this is by far the most offensive contractor that we have dealt with. The lack of integrity and transparency has been shocking.\\n\\nTroy, Field Supervisor was scheduled again to come out and take a look at the problem.  Troy never showed up and never called to say he wasn't coming.  I called again and this time Troy called me as said that he didn't need to come out and not to worry they would take care of the problem.  \\n\\nA couple days later two guys showed up with about 45 tubes of caulk.  The guys told us point blank they were instructed to caulk the windows and nothing more.  We stopped the guys and told them that caulk was not a suitable solution.  They told us that is all they had and again told use they were instructed only to caulk.  We asked them not to waste their time or caulk given the caulk around the South facing windows would have to be replaced every one to two years or so.  We didn't bargain for windows that would need that kind of maintenance every year or two.  We were looking for a solution that would last as long as the windows - a permanent solution. \\n\\nThe next two weeks was a comedy of cat and mouse as we tried and tried to get True View to come out and finish the job as promised.  There was always some excuse and finally I had to threaten to have the credit card charge reversed to get them to move.  Finally on 12/7/11 Troy showed up with some metal \\\"U\\\" channels and said they could glue them to the fronts of the windows to cover over the gap.  That just wasn't an acceptable solution and not what we had previously agreed to.  I guess Troy doesn't know that open air space around your windows is bad for the HVAC bill, especially when it is 114 degrees.  \\n\\nWe called True View the next day and explained that we had a painter on-site that would do the repair with drywall, etc. for $330.  True View refused stating they preferred to have their own people do the work.  We said fine and asked when they could come out.  Amazingly every day we were available - they were not.  \\n\\nIn the end, we will replace the windows with windows that actually fit the opening from a reputable company.  We will have the True View Windows carefully removed and will ask the Contractor's Board to instruct True View to come get their windows as part of our formal complaint to be file this week.  If the installation was this bad, we can only image the nightmare a warranty item would bring.  It never cease to amaze me, especially in this economy, how foolish people can be.  With so may good businesses going out of business it is a shame to see a bottom feeder like this still in business.",

(yuk...cannot be sanitary) or start applying polish when there's clearly old polish left on the cuticles.  I drives me crazy when the nail tech is really rough and jabs at my cuticles and actually hurts me and looks surprised when I ask that they be more gentle.

I have to give it to them for parking and line control.  But I was really disappointed in the over all layout.  They had a torch lighting ceremony that was way cool, but they were announcing the event and discussing it from the bandstand that was NO WHERE near the torch lighting, very confusing.  A majority of the event is on uneven grassy area that was wet and swampy in some spots, thank God I wore flats to this event or I would have been in dire straits.\\n\\nThe musicians I think were brought out of retirement for this event and were sorely off key.  Hard to get excited about joining the dance floor with their music.  I know they didn't have the patronage that they were waiting for because the lines were empty and yet there was no where to sit and eat.  I think people get there early find a table and camp it, not leaving room for the rest of us to enjoy a bite comfortably.\\n\\nNow the food, THE FOOD is the reason to go to this event.  Even the $7 cover charge is worth it, just to get in and pig out.  Everything we had was ON POINT and delicious.  I had a pork pita sandwich that was soooo freaking good and hubby had a lamb chop plate and left nothing on his plate.  Don't forget the Ouzo shots, they are serving a Cambas Ouzo, not my favorite, but not bad either.  They also have a GREAT kids area with lot's of things to keep them occupied.\\n\\nVendors were a great disappointment for me.  I was really looking forward to finding some Greek import items to take home with me and sadly they really weren't there.  There were lot's of vendors but they didn't have real Greek items.  Also very lacking was the fact that no Greek music was sold here (probably so you wouldn't realize how bad the band is).  There were two vendors that had actual Greek items and the jewerly they had there I was selling back in 1980's in La Jolla at my shop, nothing new, nothing worth taking home and OVER PRICED.\\n\\nBig plus military and their family has free admission, so bring your military ids and save the $7 entrance fee.  Also do not miss the desserts, you have to have to take some home with you.  No guarantees that they will make it home uneaten though, just saying.",

I just like meat and veggies, and don't eat the noodles or rice. it was fine with them. My husband and I share the same plate of thinly sliced meat and then get another together so I guess we conserve food that way, but we got four full plates of meat.  The service is very generous and they constantly ask (not in a pesky way)  if you are ready for another round or just taking a break. \\n\\nThe only unfortunate thing for me, is that my husband and I do shabu-shabu at home often and use all sorts of Asian condiments they don't have, like sesame oil, rice vinegar, etc, but still it is no biggie.  We also like to eat the beefy broth that has developed from swish-swishing the meat, they sometimes look at you a bit funny and then give you a very small bowl and very big spoon that is not very soup friendly.\\n\\nI am hugely impressed by how clean this place is.  I saw the one waiter even giving a thorough clean to each burner after it was used.     If you are a soup lover or sukiyaki lover, you must try Swish.

My wife is a two slice person at most and two of their slices was not even as filling as one slice of pizza at Marc Rich's or Broadway where we normally go. The pie was insulting and stingy. I don't know how people can rave about this pizza. It was like bread with good taste. Skip this place if you like cheese on your pizza. RIP OFF.......",

I came in with 7 people and ordered the 90 dollar combo. BEWARE!!! when you order from this place make sure you get ALL your items. First, the waitress tried to give us the check not even giving us all our items we ordered. I confronted her kindly about it, and she got mad at us. She told us fine it will come out and yells in korean to the cook to make it. I say, if you are going to talk crap in Korean, make sure the customer your talking crap about isn't Korean. After she gives us our food that we ordered she gives me the bill. FAIL AGAIN! She over charged me and so when I confronted her about the bill, she asked me if I had a local ID? I didnt know that if I wasn't local, I would be charged more? I showed a local ID and she fixed the bill. \\n\\nIt gets better after this! She tells us to hurry and give her the check cause they are closing... UM.... I didn't know 24 hour places closed..... Maybe they should put the sign to say 23 hours or 22 hours?? And the front door clearly indicates that the place is 24 hours. So, Here comes the tip portion of my bill. First of all, I tip 20 percent if deserved. This ape of a waitress didn't deserve anything after being so rude to all of us. I was kind enough to tip 13 percent because we didn't believe that she deserved even 15 percent. Not only that, she was standing next to me the whole time watching me put the tip.\\n\\nShe saw how much tip we gave her, and she told me to give her more tip. I was in so much shock that I didn't know what to say! She told me that she wanted at least 18 percent considering that she served all of us plus she gave us a \\\"discount.\\\" I THINK NOT! i flat out told her that it wasn't a discount, its the menu price. You overcharged us and I asked to give us the right price, so technically thats not a discount. Oh and the place is a library atmosphere FYI. Apparently, we irritated her by talking too loud and to lower our voices. This is at midnight, and nobody is there except the waitress and a couple. What is more disturbing than ever was that after we ate, they thought that extra protein is a good thing, because we saw cockroaches on the floor as well. \\n\\nIt doesn't matter if you are Korean or not, they don't discriminate on horrible service. If you want horrible service and not all the food you ordered, and loved to be pressured into giving tip, Come to this place! I know we are in a recession and going through rough times, but this place takes the recession to a whole new level!!!",

So if you go for anything other than the dessert (which you should just go for that) maybe try something other than the buffet. The pad thai was dry and left us feeling rather ill.

I was the first to arrive, and the hostess said to let her know when we had 10 there, and she'd seat us.  When 10 arrived, I let her know.  They started to lead us to our seats, in the Main Hall as we'd requested.\\n\\nThen, confusion strikes.  She leads us to a table with people already sitting at it, one of our group says \\\"uh...we don't know them...\\\" and she laughs, then realizes he wasn't joking, and says \\\"really?  no way!\\\"  They claimed that this other group came in and said they were us, so they gave them our table.\\n\\nHowever, I suspect the true story is that they screwed up and gave another party our table, under no fault of the people sitting at the other table.  My proof?  While we were waiting for our 10 to arrive, I heard them call \\\"Leslie, party of 6.\\\"  We were Leslie, party of 20.  So, the Leslie party of 6 was seated, then they realized they screwed up and tried to blame them for wrongly taking our seats.  Not cool.\\n\\nThe manager was involved in all of this, and he is the sole person to blame for the mistake, and the failure to fix the mistake.\\n\\nThey sent us back to the lobby and made us wait until a table for 20 was open.  By the time we were seated, it was 45 minutes past our reservation time.  We had just played 3 soccer games before going to dinner, and were all more than starving, and grumpy.  It truly sucked.\\n\\nHe tried telling us that we could just sit in the beer garden if we wanted - anyone who has been here knows that would be lame.  There is no entertainment, and it is not fun like the main hall is.  We came there to party, not have a conversation.\\n\\nWhat they should have done:  Admitted it was their mistake, not blame some other customers.  Given us free mini-beers while we waited, or at least offered us water or SOMETHING.  Apologized.\\n\\nThe manager here sucks, I won't be back.  Oh, and our server sucked and was rude to some of the people in our group, but we still had to pay the 18% tip they tacked on.  I hate that rule with a passion you would not believe.",

Given the crazy good Italian food and friendly wait staff, I find myself overlooking the super slow service. \\n\\nBestie and I started with fried calamari.  The fried version isn't on the menu so you'll have to ask for it.  It was so lightly fried and perfectly cooked.  Note that the calamari listed on the menu is sauteed I think so if you want it fried, be sure to specify that. \\n\\nFrom there we went for the date pizza \\\"datteri pizze.\\\"  Dates, meh, not really my thing but when in the desert, eat dates.  Plus, I wanted to try something different.  Dates, goat cheese, bacon and rosemary makes one heck of a pizza.  This was really good and just when I thought it couldn't get any better . . .\\n\\nNext came the chittara.  What is chittara you ask?  It is a square spaghetti like pasta that adorned with a rich and creamy smoked bacon, green peppercorns, egg-yolk parmesan sauce that will leave you in a state of pure bliss.  One bite and I closed my eyes and nearly slid off the booth under the table to some other world.  Yep, so good and I can't stop thinking about it. \\n\\nDespite being love-struck with the chittara and stuffed from the carbs we closed our meal with a dessert (since it wsa my bday).  We had Taggia's version of a tiramisu which was tasty but not as special as our previous dishes.  \\n\\nAnyway, if I go back to Scottsdale I will definitely go back to Taggia for the chittara and probably get a few items to go too!",

In the taste department, it was good. Nothing really special that makes them stand out like Easy Life Boba or Boba City Cafe.\\n\\n@ Taro w/ Boba ($3.50) - Someone in our group got this. Taro was fine, but they said the boba wasn't cooked in the center. My boba seem fine though.\\n\\n@ Truffle Parmesean Fries ($3.50) - Very good and flavorful fries, mainly because of the truffle oil. This reminds me of the awesome truffle fries at ENVY, except a lot cheaper. Probably the best fries to get out of their offerings.\\n\\n@ Garlic Salt & Pepper Fries ($3.50) - Good and flavorful as well. Taste almost identical to the truffle fries, except without the truffles. Just stick with the truffle fries, you'll get a stronger better flavor. One point I have to ding them on is the cone shape containers serving the fries makings it seem like you're getting more than you really are. Cool presentation but not good for my tummy. I also noticed that someone else from the other table go more fries than us. *Shakes fist*\\n\\n@ BBQ Bachi Burger American Wagyu w/ Cheese ($9 + $1 Cheese) - First bite made me say yes finally a restaurant burger worth its price, I can actually taste the difference in using quality ingredients. I should have spent the extra $3 to get an extra patty. Is there a limit to the # of patties I can get? Like can i get a 100x100 Wagyu burger (bwhaha).\\n\\n@ Ronin Burger & Kiki Burger ($8 each) - The others in our group got this. One says its a lot better than the stuff at Fuddruckers. Both happy with their burger.\\n\\n@ Peking Duck Steamed Buns + Pork Belly Steamed Buns ($8.50) - One person in our group decided to split the orders, so he got to try 1 of each item. This item reminds me in Vegas. Calling something Asian fusion and charging up the wazu for it. This is literally 2 buns with meat in it. Literally. You can get comparable items at Diamond bakery for a $1.25 each, a boba drink at Volcano Tea, and a banh mi sandwich at Hue Thai for a little more than the cost of this item and that would fill you up.  Sure you get a hard boiled egg and I get some salad, but thats still some crazy markup. Either charge less for this item, or give some more value for this item. This is more of an appetizer than an entree. \\n\\n@ Portuguese Donuts w/ Vietnamese Cinnamon + Coffee Gelato ($4) - This is donut holes with cinnamon and a side of coffee ice cream. So Portuguese donuts is a type of donut. But WTF is Vietnamese cinnamon? The waitress said its just cinnamon and it sure is. The donuts were okay (like you have to try to make a donut taste bad), but stuff at Ronalds taste a lot better. The coffee gelato ice cream is just okay as well. I guess they wanted to take a twist on coffee and donuts.\\n\\n@ Cherry Glazed Pop Tart w/ Gelato ($4) - Pop Tart? I think everyone has memories of those Kellogs Pop Tarts you toast into a toaster as a child. Well now that we're all grown up and more sophisticated, we have a restaurant pop tart. The combo of the pop tart and gelato is good. Has a good flakey crust. Definitely something to order if you don't want a coffee based desert.   \\n\\nService is very friendly. They ensure that everything is good and ask if you need anything. When the kitchen got backed up, the waitress did acknowledge this and apologized.\\n\\nThe wait time is a little ridiculous. I don't expect fast food times, but 30 mins is a little ridiculous. Then another 20 minutes for desert. The kitchen got backed up, but how do you get backed up with only 2 table orders? I can imagine how bad it might get when this place gets filled up to a higher occupancy rate.  \\n\\nNew restaurants are traditionally understaffed, but surprising this place seem overstaff . On a Friday night, you have 4 waitresses, with only 6 tables with patrons. Over staff at the front of the house much? It seems like there was 1 person solely just making boba drinks, but I saw the waiters making the drinks as well. Then you have another person who looks to be manning the cashier and not doing much. Then you have the overseeing owner or manager taking care of paperwork. With all of these people \\\"busy\\\", you have 2 cooks in the kitchen. Maybe they need to devote more staff to getting the food out in a timely fashion, instead of doing damage control towards its patron for the long wait.\\n\\nThe food is good no doubt. But pricing on some items is questionable. Just because something is Asian Fusion or you give it a fancy name, doesn't mean you can charge more for it. They have a friendly staff, but they also need to work on getting food out in a more timely fashion. A great restaurant that might have a bright future if they address some of these issues.",

It definitely is not sizzling when you get it. Tastes like teriyaki after awhile. I know I will be sticking to my skewers (which I still have to try all the different types). My friend got the beegee mix but that's just all the meat.\\n\\nIf you have a party of 4 or more, make sure you call in ahead of time and ask for the yelp special + it would definitely help so they can make your orders ahead of time or something. It does take a LONG time if there's a lot of orders (especially with other guests). Make sure you have time.",

For appetizers, we had the fritto misto, the caprese and the caesar salad.  All three were delicious; the basil on the caprese is served in the form of a mousse which was pretty cool.\\n\\nFor our entrees, my mom had the beef, my dad had the ravioli and i had the amatriciana.  All 3 were excellent.  For dessert, we finished with the chocolate lava cake and I asked for a big candle since it was my dad's birthday.  The waiter was very apologetic that they didn't have a big candle and instead offered to stick two candles together, which I thought was funny and sweet.  Overall, our experience here was very good and we got out in perfect time to see the show.  \\n\\nAlso, since we were one of the first groups seated, we got to sit right by the window and have an amazing view of the Bellagio water show.

She also let us swap out some pancetta with scallops in a risotto starter so that was cool. It was good, lacked depth though in my opinion, and the scallops themselves were a little over cooked yet didn't have much of a crusty outside from the sear. I'm going to say the pan wasn't hot enough and they were in there too long. Cesar salad was probably the highlight. Salad? Yup. Roasted red peppers should come on EVERYTHING and this salad proves that. The dressing was mild yet tangy, and dressed the romaine enough that each leaf was coated, but not overly so that it became soggy. And theeeeeeeeeeen my entree. Whole wheat pasta with vegetables and sausage in an \\\"herbed broth\\\". First of all, I have no idea what \\\"herbed broth\\\" means. Is that like chicken stock with thyme? Second of all, there was no broth and thus there was no flavor. Third, the amount of pasta was overwhelming. They don't make it there because nobody would send out (I'm not joking) nearly a box of penne in a bowl. It was nuts. I ate around most of it but found the veggies to be way overcooked and the sausage while made in house lacked the flavor profile that I'm used to from Nostrano and Underground meats. \\nMy biggest pet peeve though is being told I'm supposed to leave, without being asked. At about 9:00pm or so a bus boy came by sweeping the dining room into a dirty little pile of the evening's food scraps, bread crumbs and dust. Then he started to re-arrange furniture. Then the music faded. Look you guys, tell me it's time to go and I'll go, but we made a reservation for 9:00pm, we got there at 8:30pm which you were excited about and you told us you close at 10:00pm. \\nA few months ago I stopped at a Culvers just as they were closing, asked if I could grab a burger and they said, \\\"As long as our doors are still open, we're here for the customer.\\\" \\nCulvers!",

I couldn't even enjoy my time spent during Alkaline Trio and left early. I will not be attending any more shows here, and will make sure my friends know how much of a waste of money this venue is. Save your money unless its a band you absolutely have to see.",

            "input": "Stayed here for the MLK weekend since we had comps at TI. We drove from LA after work on Friday so we got to Vegas around 12am-1am. When we got there, we tried to book into our room (2 Queens, non smoking) but then the front desk advised us that our room has been double booked and that the only room available is a 1 bd smoking. For everyone that doesn't smoke, a smoking room is a really bad option for it just reeks of cigarettes! We asked for any other room which of course they said \\\"We are TOTALLY booked for the weekend\\\" reply. We asked for anything else that we can get comp'ed on since we were given this unfortunate ordeal, which the front desk replied \\\"Nope\\\". After trying for about 15 minutes, we reluctantly took the keys and just slept in our stinky room.\\n\\nSomehow it gets worse here. We started gambling in TI and I guess lady luck was with us because my friend was on FIRE. He was literally winning hundreds then thousands. After a few hours of hot streak, the pit bosses of the hotel started following us and started to whisper stuff into the dealers ears during our table games. Maybe we were just being paranoid but this made us feel REALLY uneasy. And whenever we cashed out on our winnings, it would take 10-15 minutes. Yes, I know when you win big, they have to verify where we won, etc. (this isn't our first time) but this was taking longer than usual. One thing that made us feel REALLY skeptical was when my friend was betting on my other friend's hand during blackjack. We were all having fun playing this way until the 10th/11th time, my friend tried to bet, the pitboss actually came and said that we can't do that anymore. We argued that we HAVE been playing like that the past 2 days and why all of a sudden, no? Well like some weird coincidence, the hand that the pit boss intervened on was a blackjack. Luck? Maybe but it was just a weird vibe after that. \\n\\nMost likely we'll get comp'ed for TI because of my friend's earnings but even with the free comp, we doubt we'll stay at TI with this bad experience. For a Vegas hotel that's been around as long as TI, you would think they would expect people to have luck once in a while and they would treat their customers with the usual Vegas service.",

I was a little confused as I was unsure exactly what I was waiting for.  I assumed a menu.  After about 15 minutes of not another single person even looking in our direction or speaking a word to us, we left.  I'm still not entirely sure what I was supposed to be waiting for.

She then told me she would have to call to find out when I could be put on the schedule, but their scheduler is hard to reach, so she would get back to me. I asked for a quote in writing. She literally took a business card and wrote \\\"Both eyes for $3600\\\" on the back. I received a call from her 4 business days later with one date of when I could have the procedure.

Now, this is the first time that I have ordered from Vermont, but I've had it catered before, and so I wanted to get some delivered to my house. So I call, order three full sandwiches, one half, and three cookies. No special orders or add-ons. All as they come. The bloke on the phone says that it's going to be 40 minutes. I'm at the extreme edge of their service radius, and it's about to be lunch time, so I figure, that's totally acceptable, and I go about my business.  \\n\\nAbout 45 minutes go by, and I'm feeling the munch, so I give them a holler and I realize that he never gave me a total while I wait on hold for five minutes, he comes back to the line and tells me that the order left 'seven or eight minutes ago', so it should be in my hungry hands shortly. I take it in stride, I've been in a good mood all day, it's all good. \\n\\nAnother twenty minutes go by, and I've gone from completely calm and not at all affected to full-on angry. The driver finally shows- an hour and a half late, and I've never been this upset about a sandwich before in my life. No apology whatsoever for being egregiously late- something that would result in free food with many other establishments- and then he hands me the check. I'm about to sign the slip, then I do some quick math and realize that they charged me 75.00!! For four sandwiches! \\n\\nFor keeping my cool, I deserve a Green Lantern ring, but I hand it back to the driver and tell him that I'm not signing it, and he tells me that the guy ringing it up screwed up the order. Yeah, I see that. You charged me double. That's more than a mistake. \\n\\nHe leaves, promising to have someone call me, I take the sandwiches, hoping to at least enjoy my food- nope. Cold. Should have guessed. Half an hour later, someone finally gets back to me, and explains that they overcharged me- still no apology for my food taking twice as long as it was supposed to, mind you, and he said that he was going to void the original charge (it's still showing in my bank account as a charge), and recharge me, but he was going to take the cookies off. Because that would make it all better. \\n\\nI asked him how much he was charging me for, and he responded 'I have no idea'. Again, I managed to not kick a hole in the nearest child and wear it as a bleeding backpack capable of hatred. I don't even think that I let my open-faced contempt seep into my voice when I asked him to find out how much so I didn't wind up with a hundred dollar charge because I wanted a sandwich. He finally came back with a total, and I ended the call. \\n\\nWhen I first stumbled across their site, I didn't get around to ordering because they stop delivering right around the time I get home and they don't have an online option for ordering, but my office started getting their food catered in. I want to tell them to stop. I've not had to deal with that much BS to just get a simple meal over the past two years.  Never. Never. Ever again.",

After seating, service was slow. \\n\\nOur apps were good. The duck fat fries were good but many places in Madison boast great fries. The dates were to die for. \\n\\nAs for the meal... eek. Our plates came out one at a time with about ten minutes in between each, making the meal very very awkward. My friend ordered the ravioli, which the waiter said was a favorite but the plate was the most unappetizing thing I've ever seen. Literally one big brown ravioli with egg inside. My friend said the sauce was very very sweet. \\n\\nMine was served next. I can't find it on their current online menu but I am certain I ordered a pasta and bolognese dish that sounded pretty safe. It tasted exactly like Hamburger Helper, I am not even kidding you. Hamburger. Effing. Helper. A great kickback to my childhood but definitely not something I expected nor wanted to pay for from this trendy restaurant. \\n\\nFriend's husband ordered the Chicken Thigh which was the best, juiciest chicken I've ever had. The sides it was served with weren't bad either. I would go back to give that another try. \\n\\nMy husband ordered the tripe and none of us had a bite of it. \\n\\nFor dessert we did an apple thing that wasn't great and a panna cotta, which was okay. \\n\\nAll in all, I'm glad we tried it because of all the hype. but we all walked out wondering what all the hype was about.

Me and my family were looking for a place to go eat menudo, we wanted a real good, flavorful menudo, and while we were driving, Yelp! took us there, with the promise of good menudo. When we got there, there was a line, but that only meant to us, that there was good food too.\\nWe were looking at the menu, while moving up to the cashier, and noticed that they do not serve menudo... like EVER! So, that was a little deceiving. (The website says they have it on Saturdays, but that is the day we visited and NADA!)\\nWhen we got there, my kiddos got a bean and cheese burrito, which, if it wasn't for the good tortillas, it would have been the same as ordering one at taco bell. My hubby ordered the Oaxaca style burrito, that had nothing very \\\"Oaxacan\\\" about (\\\"Beef Chorizo with Beans, Potatoes, Cheese\\\"... Oaxaca, me think not!), along with a tamal, don't remember what kind, didn't mater, wasn't good either.\\nI ordered the green chile beef, which I was looking forward to. When we got our order, our kids enjoyed their burritos, my husband was OK with his, enjoyed the tortilla very much, but said that nothing special, and me, when I started eating it, a white goo came flowing out... it looked like the sticky goo we use to make home-made pi\\u00f1atas called \\\"Engrudo\\\", which is a mix of hot water and enough flour to get a gooey consistency, and I think that's what they served me with some chunks of tenderly cooked beef. I went up to the cashier, and told her that my green chile wasn't green, that it looked like \\\"engrudo,\\\" she said that was the green chile, I asked \\\"Is it supposed to look like this?\\\" she gave me a little shy smile and said yes... the ladies making the tortillas just looked up and smiled at me, and I went back to my seat, opened up my burrito, picked out the beef chunks, scraped off the goo, and ate my tortilla... So, no. If you ask me if I am going back to Carolina's again, my answer is no. It too long of a ride, too bad of a food for me to do that.

There is a limit of 4 people on it so my husband rode with my daughter right after us.

If you are not coming to play for 2 days, or don't have kids or at least 4 people ..then it may be less worth it to you. \\n\\nThe pizza rocked!! We got one on my bday last Tues and be sure to ask for extra cheese!! We were hooked up :)) I was a little thrown back by the MagiQuest for my daughter. The wand is SO expensive ..but it allows them to stay busy with the quest for hours. She requested much help however. \\n\\nNote: You do not have to purchase a wand topper!! The wand was like $17 and up.. then they have a big selection of toppers for the same price! I turned to the clerk and said, \\\" You have to purchase one of these toppers to use this wand?\\\" So, what do you know... he pulls out a box of silver grey rounded off toppers that you get free with the wand. Why are these hidden under the counter?? Ok, thought $17.99 and tax was still pricey for a plastic wand when we were then informed that we needed to place it in the activator. Geez. another $17 I believe. At any rate it came to a total of $35ish and she only completed 2 quests!!! So, It is hard to say no with all the other kiddies running around with the wand BUT all in all the entire trip was very worth it as we took full advantage of the 2 days and left at 8 on the second day. \\n\\nThe restaurant was way too expensive other than pizza for us, so we ordered in delivery Chinese to our room and they did come all the way to our room to deliver. The pizza is reasonable and would definitely recommend! We ordered 2 separate times-about $11 bucks. They have icee's , dippin dots, nachos, pretzels etc inside the waterpark. \\n\\nWe found that the right side of the wave pool gets a higher wave. I got a small headache the second day riding the tornado.

Okay, so I sit back and wait.\\n\\nMy meal comes out fairly quickly in a big styrofoam container and I make my way back to work.

The bun was some horrible white-bread concoction I could get at a cheap company picnic. The meat had no flavor... no BBQ flavor at all! They did give me a container of sauce which I immediately dumped all over the meat, but it didn't have a kick to it... it was just kind of blah. The cucumber salad was not refreshing. It was soaked in a very, very sweet slime-sauce. I felt like I was eating straight-up high fructose corn syrup (and I probably was). The fries were uneventful, just fries, nothing more.\\n\\nI highly doubt I would give Memphis BBQ another try. I'd probably just go to Famous Dave's if I wanted mediocre BBQ.",

Dr Kaplan on my very first visit sat with me for more than 30 minutes to ensure he got an accurate history from me.

I think there was one hostess as well. \\n\\nWhen we first walked in at 3 pm, the start of happy hour, we saw a sign that said they'd be closing at 5 for their staff holiday party.  We are attributing this to the horrible service we received thinking they were too busy getting ready for the party and in a hurry to get us out of there so they could enjoy their party.  \\n\\nIt took about 3 minutes to be seated (again...there were only 3 other tables of people at the time).  Then once we were seated, we waited about 6 minutes to even get a waitress to come over and get our drink order...and all we ordered was water!  Again, we then waited about 5 minutes to get the water and for someone to come take our order.  Once the person came over, who happened to actually be the bartender, we ordered garlic edamame and told her we were ready to order our sushi.  But she walked away and didn't come back for another 10 minutes or so to take our order.  \\n\\nThe garlic edamame were not garlicky at all.  We paid more for the garlic version and there was barely even a hint of extra flavor.  \\n\\nWe ordered the Cougar Roll this time after seeing so many people order it.  Not only was it not what the hype made it out to be, but the cucumber was very overpowering and the shrimp was quite fishy tasting.  We also got the Buffalo Chicken rolll, which isn't exactly sushi, but we were unimpressed.  The combo of the sticky rice and the heavy chicken (which were in tempura...yum!) wasn't quite right.  The buffalo flavor only lasted a few seconds b/c the sauce was only drizzled on top of the rolls...I think it would have been soooooo much better if the chicken had been covered in the sauce instead.  Last but definitely the least was the Jibs roll.  I loved the tempura of course and the cream cheese, but it wasn't really that flavorful sadly.  :-(\\n\\nAll in all, we paid $40 for our 3 rolls and the edamame and it was way too pricey for the horrible service and the not so tasty rolls.  It was not worth the price or the drive.  I won't be returning at all after this latest experience.

            "input": "I will try to keep this as succinct as possible as renting a car from Las Vegas Exotic Car Rentals became a long drawn out back-and-forth.  In the end I it has become clear that I will never do business with them again and would not recommend them to any of my friends.  Essentially here is the timeline of events: \\n\\nIn March 2014 I reserved this agencies' Ferrari F430 Spider for 24 hours in May 2014 , I primarily dealt with Daniel throughout this process. \\n\\nIn May I picked up the car from Daniel and began driving it to Red Rock Canyon as Daniel had suggested. I was not impressed with the multiple damages we had noted prior to leaving with the car including but not limited to- broken clips in the roof tonneau cover (causing it to pop up), missing park distance sensor, dent on rear quarter panel, scratches on passenger door, rash on all 4 wheels, etc.  In any case these damages were noted so I wouldn't be charged for them and I happily drove off in the 430. \\n\\nIt soon became apparent that this car had not been well maintained, first the wheel had to be held at a 15* angle in order for it to not pull strongly to the right, the tires felt loose and upon inspecting them I noted that the rears were almost completely bald, it also had difficulty getting into reverse, among other issues.  Despite these I made it to Red Rock, but upon touring the Park I realized the car would not shift (via the paddle shifters) from 3rd to 2nd. In fact when I tried to shift down (between these two gears only) the car would drop into neutral and warning lights would flash on the dash.  I immediately called LVECR and informed Daniel of this issue, he told me to bring it back immediately which I did.  \\n\\nUpon arriving back at his office he asked what happened, I explained, and he said he would take it for a test drive.  When he got back from his drive he told me that he experience what I had explained and said that the prior renter didn't complain of such an issue.  I told him it only happened when you manually shifted using the paddles, if you put the car in Auto mode it would shift fine, perhaps the prior renters didn't manually downshift.  Anyway he said he would give me a refund and then release my deposit pending a scan of the car's ECU the following day.  After a couple days my deposit was released however he did not refund my payment, I attempted to call them twice and left voicemails both times, I also sent an email but did not receive a response. I then disputed the charge with my credit card company and they refunded me.  End of story? Unfortunately not.\\n\\nFast forward to October 2014, my credit card company contacts me and says that they have been in dispute with LVECR's bank and the bank is refusing to release my payment. My credit card company and I go back and forth for a couple of weeks and eventually I learn that my CC company and the bank had been going back and forth for months and at this point they were done trying and would be charging me for the rental.  A rental which I had for approximately 4 hours of the 24 I had paid for.  It didn't matter what I told my credit card company or what evidence I produced, they said that they could no longer dispute it.\\n\\nA couple weeks later I receive a letter from my credit card company including the \\\"official statement\\\" from Daniel, it states that I had \\\"overheated the car's fluids which cause the transmission to malfunction\\\".  I was amazed.  I had no idea that I possessed the ability to overheat the fluids on a $200,000 super car on the streets of Las Vegas going to Red Rock.  Nor that \\\"overheating the fluids\\\" would cause such a car to not be able to downshift from 3rd to 2nd. At the end of the day it turned out that Daniel was in fact an unethical business person who did not want to let go of my payment, although for some reason did not come after me for any repair costs, so I guess at least there's that.",

I should have walked away after the girl behind the counter had such a big attitude as if I was bothering her. I wasn't even taking a long time to order. She obviously has her bun on her head too tight and it is causing rude behavior. Ugh!  Guess I am glad that the pastries suck because based on the service alone I wouldn't come back. Ok now on to the food. The macaroons taste of pure sugar no flavor just sweet. The almond danish was so hard I could have cracked a tooth. The peanut butter chocolate cake was very moist but again no flavor. I've had better tasting cake from Costco. I got a few other items and didn't even try them. Not worth the calories or disappointment. Thank goodness Chef Flemming's was still open for some redemption from this debacle.",

Craving Indian food, we stopped into Copper Kettle which is located in the closest shopping center to the school.  It's not often that I feel invisible, but the poor service we received here made me feel that way.  There were only two other occupied tables when we walked in, and the wait staff made me feel like I was intruding on something important.  They were all standing around a table and I had to actually make eye contact to get the head nod directing us to our seats.  After asking for water three times, we finally got it WITH our entrees (not to mention that you can't order a Kingfisher to wash your meal down because they don't sell alcoholic beverages).  Yes, they ignored all of our requests for something to drink until they could bring it with our food.  The food was actually fine.  We ordered three vegetarian dishes - the lentils, vegetable curry and a cauliflower dish.  The spice level was right but the portions were pretty small.  And, they charge for rice.   That's one of my biggest pet peeves.  Has the price of basmati rice gone up so much that you have to make me feel silly for asking if it's included?  I love Indian/Pakistani food, but the poor service here was more memorable than my stomach's happiness so I don't think I'll be returning if I find myself in the area again.",

I can get the connection on my laptop, but it won't load up any pages.....don't know what the problem is, when I land in Vegas or San Diego, it works just fine there.\\n\\n\\n- Car Rental return lanes through the airport is confusing.  I am willing to bet that 9 out of 10 people who try to find the car rental return lane have to attempt it at least 2 or 3 times to figure it out.....the directions and route is crazy confusing.  The rental center itself is convenient, and the process of returning your car is efficient, but driving there is a disaster.\\n\\n- Food options are limited once you go past security.  Not much going on there.\\n\\n- Gates have insufficient seating.  I don't get it....there's not enough seats at most of the gates.....it's very crowded and people are cramped all over the place.\\n\\nHopefully, they can upgrade it soon....it needs it.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 100%, but not by choice.",

But, both times I was happy with the quality of the food served to us. \\n\\nThis place is located in the MGM Casino, but once you're inside, you kind of forget you're in a casino - unless, of course, you look out the glass things. They have a cool wood design thing around the exit, and the rest is very modern. White tables, glass almost everywhere. I really like it. There's almost always a wait for it, but so far, it's only been about 10 - 15 minutes for us until we're seated. \\n\\nGenerally, everything on their menu is quite pricey. However, I feel like that's simply the cost for going to a celebrity chef's restaurant. \\n\\nThe first time we were here, I got the salmon, which was flaky and good. However, even though it was really empty, our food took forever to get to our table! And to top it off, everything was cold! We were so disappointed. However, our waiter at that time was very courteous. The guy (a cute one, I might add) who brought our food to the table overheard us say we were there to have a dinner celebration for my grandma's birthday. We thought nothing further of it. He disappeared for a while, because he wasn't our waiter. However, at the end of the meal, he came back with a slice of a chocolate tart for us, with a lit candle stuck into it! We were so touched that he remembered (not to mention, it was free! )\\n\\n\\nOur second time here, the food was way better. Their bread basket is a mixture of all kinds of things, including pretzel bread and carmelized onion topping square of fluffy bread. I was quite satisfied with the overall service, but I feel like the people who work here are quietly snobby. When I asked for another basket of bread (because our food was taking quite a while), the waiter made us repeat our request twice, with an incredulous expression. What? Just because a majority of the people there were pretty girls in short dresses doesn't mean I have to eat the tiny amount they pretend is enough for them. Just give me more bread without your judgement, please!\\n\\nMy mother got the organic chicken with veggies and yukon mashed potatoes. Let me say, I still crave those veggies. I think they were butter sauteed. Whatever it was, it was soo delicious. The chicken was yummy, as well. \\n\\nI got the lasagna, because I was craving something filling. Though many people would be outraged at me ordering something so simple, I feel like it was well worth it. There's nothing typical about this lasagna. At first glance, I was quite miffed that I had got one small looking square. However, halfway through, I realized that through it was small, whatever was in it made it really hearty. I was full about halfway through.  Yummy!\\n\\nAnother great thing : They're open until 6 am !",

Some things however, are unacceptable.\\n\\nThe extent of which your patio had spider webs, under the table, on the chairs, and on the ceiling is beyond unacceptable.  I understand it is outside and next to the water, making that a challenge, but it is a challenge that comes with such a space.  I imagine the investment in a power washer would be wise.  Especially since your patio is essentially your prime seating area.  If you get nothing from reading this, get that.\\n\\nIn terms of service, some things need to happen.  First, and more important than anything else as far as improving service at your establishment goes, is seating points.  It hasn't happened every time I have eaten there, but the one time it did happen was rediculous.  The server painfully, obviously, had either no regard or no idea what seating points are.  EVERY dish that was delivered to our table was auctioned off.  EVERY dish.  Not one, not a few, not a majority.  All of them.  That is insane to me.   \\n\\nThere were other little things that I am not going to get into because I don't want to sound like an anal bastard, and because I am in the industry, I feel disgusted that I have to even write this review as I do really love your place.  I wasn't going to write this, or post this, because I love your place.  Then I realized that is the exact reason why I need to.

It is well known, I believe, for it's family style offerings, so that's probably the key.

The Asian inspired Marinated Eggplant with serrano chili , peanuts and enoki mushrooms was pretty good but was an extremely small portion for $7.00. I am guessing the piece we shared was two and half inches long and approx. an inch and a half wide. Not a big deal but I think it should be mentioned.\\n\\nMy waiter didn't completely describe the pig of the week sandwich and left out the Greek Yogurt Sauce in his description and neglected to give my husband his choice of side. We didn't say anything about receiving chips instead of a salad or fries but my husband had to say something about the yogurt sauce since he HATES yogurt and doesn't eat it and pulled the top bun off the sandwich since it had a big spread of yogurt on it. Our waiter did check on us and offered to bring my husband another dish but neglected to bring my husband a yogurt free bun top. With all that being said Everything else about the plate was excellent down to even the house made pickle.\\n\\nMy salad was amazing, the kind of salad that makes you hear angels sing. The horseradish honey vinaigrette dressing had the perfect layers of sweet , heat and deliciousness. My arugula salad had fresh figs, sweet and spicy pecans, chewy apricots and slightly crisp spaghetti squash it was so interesting. At first I thought it was very fine crunchy cabbage but it was spaghetti squash. All the different tastes and textures were very good. It's optional to add protein to your salad and since I can eat chicken or steak anytime I went for the sand dabs. They were very charred but not burnt. I think the char was intentional because it tasted good that way. This certainly was an over the top very good salad.\\n\\nIt's not my intention to end this on a sour note but our waiter brings us dessert menus and accidentally gives us two different menus. The waiter returns and we asked what menu do we order from and he didn't know and returns with the answer so we went with what was called White Chocolate Strawberry Short Cake. What we received were tart marinated strawberries topped with some crumbs and a BIG side of lemony white chocolate cream. I wouldn't get this dessert again as it wasn't naughty or tasty to me like what I want in dessert. I'm not really sure if it really should have even been called a strawberry short cake since it didn't have any cake only crumbs on the top. It was sort of weight watchers if you held back on eating all that cream. I think it was like an unfrozen parfait in a dish. I do note I have had very good desserts from Bink Restaurants just this last one didn't do it for me but it might for someone else.\\n\\nOverall a four star rating because of so so service some dishes are well crafted big hits but a few  misses.",

Well I said, let's try 5th and Wine since I have heard great things about this place and I have been dying to come. Sold!!! \\n\\nWe arrived and were seated immediately. The decor is really nice in this place. Laid back couches, red and black chairs, huge patio. I mean it looks and feels really swank. Love it! Our waiter John came over immediately to introduce himself and to let us know that he would be taking care of us that evening and that he did. \\n\\nWe started off by ordering some wine. Emily had the Petite Syrah I believe and I ordered the Red Knot (one of my favs). Both were excellent (we each ended up having two glasses so you know they were good) We then ordered the prosciutto, mascarpone cheese , figs and tomato jam bruschetta and the peppercorn-crusted steak, with creamy horseradish bruschetta. OMG the prosciutto one was definitely the favorite of the night. Not to take anything away from the peppercorn - crusted steak bruschetta because it was delicious as well, but something about that prosciutto mixed with that creamy texture of the mascarpone cheese followed by the sweet figs and the tart tomato jam, YUM! We each ordered the same entree which was the brie stuffed chicken and figs and lets just say that is when the meal started to semi- fail. \\n\\nNow John kinda warned us when we ordered this dish as he said it was getting mixed reviews so to let him know how it turns out. I should have known better. I will say that the potatoes and the green beans were very tasty and the chicken was juicy, HOWEVER when you say that a chicken breast is going to be stuffed with brie and with figs, you kinda expect that. The chicken breast was stuffed with brie but only at the very end of the chicken breast. As far as figs, its not figs, its fig jam and its used very sparely like the brie. We even found out the the chef only puts a small tablespoon of brie in the brie stuffed chicken. Hmm that is not stuffed. If you are going to advertise it as brie stuffed chicken, make sure that the brie is throughout the chicken and not at the \\\"butt\\\" of the chicken breast. I kept cutting into it and was like where is the brie? I was almost done when I found it. Semi FAIL! \\n\\nNeedless to say Scott V. heard that I was not exactly thrilled with the dish and that I was going to review this on yelp (Thanks John :) ) and he came over to personally apologize. I let him know that the dish was good, I mean we both finish our dish, however it was not as advertised. There was nothing stuffed about that chicken breast and just take off the fig and just leave the fig jam as there are no actual figs in the dish. (fig jam does not count as figs) So to make amends he offered to buy us dessert. Dang that man knows my weakness and it's dessert. We ordered the ghirardelli brownie with vanilla ice cream and raspberries topped with a drizzle of chocolate sauce. OMG that made up for the chicken. It came out warm and it was truly divine! \\n\\nAll in all, it was a great place. The live band that was on the patio was jamming, the staff were friendly, the wine and even the food was delish and the company was awesome! (Thank you Emily) I will definitely be back to 5th and Wine VERY soon. \\n\\nSide note: Thank you again to John our fabulous server and Scott V. for the lovely dessert and for listening to me voice my concerns.",

Personally I liked getting some of the salt on the seaweed.. otherwise it's a little too light. \\n\\nFor appetizers, we ordered the Grilled Ribs.. which was SUPER YUMMY.. awesome flavoring, though slightly dry this time.. and pork sliders trio on lightly toasted hawaiian bread (which wasn't on the menu, but I hear they have a secret menu, so it might be on that??) Edamane was served with a garlicy soy sauce reduction and the same infused sea salt from the seaweed..it was VERY tasty. i'm not used to putting sauce on my edamane, but i have to admit, it was GOOD.\\n\\nI ordered the waffle stuffed with sweet chicken curry. it came with two eggs.. i'd probably recommend it as a breakfast item or something on a very empty stomach. i couldn't finish the waffle cuz i was already getting really full. But the curry inside was good, not too spicy. eggs were cooked according to your request, i went with over medium. So in the end, I ditched the half waffle and ate the curry and eggs. \\nThe guys ordered a ramen ( i forgot to ask him how he liked it, but it looked good) and the steak salad. I was very impressed with the presentation of the salad. it looked delish. \\n\\nDessert was so good. I only had a small bite though if I wasn't so full, i wouldn't have shared. we had the strawberry custard brulee, which now that i look isn't actually on the menu either. ha. lucky us! seriously, i would have licked the bowl clean if I wasn't dying of fullness. \\n\\nall in all, i was impressed with the food, service (waiter was very good about checking in on us often, refilling water glasses etc) and decor. the bathroom signs are the best. very clever.",

The decor is no-frills, but the woman working at the register was super-friendly, and the free salsa bar with pickled carrots and chips was a great way to start our lunch. \\n\\nI had the carnitas (~$7.50) and my husband had the burro/enchilada combo plate ($6.50). The carnitas weren't as savory as the ones I've had elsewhere (Los Dos Molinos is a good example), but they were seasoned well and came with some of the best rice and beans I've ever had. My husband's seasoned beef (in the burro) was also not intensely fllavorful but was still decent. His enchilada was a real standout; the sauce had just the right amount of chile flavor and spice and the cheese was perfectly gooey - not soggy, not congealed. We wished we had forgone things with meat and just ordered 6 cheese enchiladas as our meal! Overall, though, we were definitely impressed with the food and would definitely return. \\n\\nJust as an FYI - they do take credit cards but charge a transaction fee ($.50) so you might want to just bring cash.

The apartments are located in a residential area, allowing extra walking time with our dog.  They are pet friendly, though the $300 non-refundable deposit is a little hefty.  Their weakest link is their customer service.  We were not e-mailed our lease until 6:00 pm the day before we were to move in. even though we met with them two weeks earlier.  They do offer to paint one wall at no cost from their selection of colors, but didn't tell us we had to contact their service department to schedule it.  In fact, everything that was on our move-in checklist they required that we contact their service department. The grounds are well-cared for and the residents are a good mix of age groups.  \\nThere is plenty of parking; gated community.  Our 1 bedroom unit is spacious and has a wonderful large patio.

I thought I swore off Bodyheat because of the crowd coming from the nearby gym, but now I remeber it was because of the pushiness and rudeness of sales.  The woman was extremely passive aggressive and completely pressured me into signing a contract when I only wanted a one time session.  \\n\\nWhen I first walked in, there was a male clerk, I explained to him that I don't tan often (2-4 times a year) and just wanted a high power bed for one time.  He was ready to sign me up and just let me go my 10 minutes as requested, great!  All of a sudden this woman (manager maybe) jumps in and starts talking to me about the packages and how I'm wasting my money.  I keep saying \\\"I just want one time\\\" she then goes  she insists and insists I sign up.  After declining over and over she finally signs me up for one session.  She then proceeds to ask me about my lotion and to see it, she shakes it, tells me its old and says I must buy a new one.  So I buy an small package.  She then says that I'm not making a good decision because if we prorate my mounth it's cheaper than what I am paying for one session.  So at this point I think \\\"Oh I guess a package would be cheaper.\\\"  She signs me up for the 10 month because there's no additional membership fee, in my head I know this is something I don't want, but felt so pressured that I signed the contract.  \\n\\nI didn't even get my 10 minute power nap in because the entire time in the bed I kept thinking how I made a mistake and wanted to reverse what just happened.  After the bed went off I put my clothes back on as fast as I could and went out to the front.  There was a line ahead of me so I waiting.  She kept asking how my experience was and I just kept saying \\\"fine.\\\"  When I get back to her, I tell her that I cannot commit to a 10 month contract as my husband and I are trying to get pregnant.  She then becomes very hostile and  sternly asks why didn't I express this to her earlier!?!  I tried to justify myself that I have a lot going on and only want the one time.  I would like to reverse my card and only pay the one time fee.   She tells me that this is something that cannot be done and I shouldn't even tan even if I'm trying and to cancel the contract is a $210 fee!  She tells me that I have to call corporate.  \\n\\nI walked out to my car and called the number she gave me.  The girl was very helpful, she defused the situation by lowering my memebership to a month to month to a level one bed at only $35 without the $20 memebership fee rather  of the $89 I was forced into.  I am going to cancel my membership at the end of the month, I will not be returning.",

The place was decorated very modern with dim lights. Lots of large tables for big parties. The host told us that our server was too busy to help us so he was going to serve us. First time I've ever heard if this. The host was able to tell us about the menu and was very helpful. The place had lots of people but wasn't that busy. We were the only table being served by the host. I thought this was strange and we saw the server. I didn't think he was that busy to take our order. Oh well so be it. \\n\\nSo I ordered the Carne Asada Street Taco Plate. This came with 3 tacos, black beans, and rice. I wasn't too impressed. I thought it was pretty bland. No taste at all. My son had the Grilled Chicken Burrito and it came with rice and beans. The Burrito has huge. I tried a portion of this and it was as bland as the Street Tacos. My wife had the Ensenada (fish) Taco Plate and she was not impressed either. At first I thought it was just my dish but after trying everyone's dishes I got to say the food was just bland. \\n\\nSo since our server was our host, it seemed like we were ignored a lot. The server bypassed our table and filled all the other tables except ours. We all recognized that and thought that was very rude. After we were almost all finished then the server started to take care of us. Filled our cups and gave us more chips. Little too late. \\n\\nI don't understand why the host had to serve us. There was a table after us that got seated and their server helped them out. Why were we targeted only? This didn't help make our meal enjoyable and the food just didn't seem up to par. \\n\\nAll I have to say is I'm very disappointed at the service and food.",

When we found ourselves in the area last weekend, we wanted to see what all had changed, and this was at the top of our list. Surprisingly, we have never set foot in a Super Target so this was a first for us. \\n\\nAHHHHHMAZING! \\n\\nThis place is huge. I knew it would be, but wow!! The grocery section is really what makes it \\\"super\\\" but the rest of the store is larger than your average Target. Some of the departments carried additional merchandise but it did seem like there was a lot of empty space. It's that time in the season where summer stuff starts to go on clearance to make room for the new items coming in so this could have contributed to that.\\n\\nThe grocery section is nice..not as abundant as your average supermarket of course, but they did have a decent selection. I normally wouldn't choose to buy produce and meat from a Target, but if I lived in the area I might consider buying from this one. There isn't an onsite butcher, all meat is prepacked (like a Trader Joe's) but there is an onsite Bakery and Prepared Foods area. Items were competitively priced, I didn't notice any great deals or anything that was overpriced. Einstein's Bagels has a self serve case in the bakery section, that that looked pretty sad. The other food aisles were well stocked and easy to shop.\\n\\nTarget, in general, is one of my favorite stores. As far as product, stores are consistent. At this location the prices are higher than my local store but that wouldn't stop me from coming here if I was in the area and needed to pick up some things. The store is really clean, employees are nice, and if I lived nearby I'm sure I would be here everyday. This store is a great upgrade from the one that was here 6 years ago.",

The roll that it was served on was toasted, yet still rubbery in texture.  Not chewy like good crusty bread, but rubbery  like they had microwaved it!   My husband had the ahi sandwich.  I didn't try it, but I could tell it was a little skimpy on the ahi.  His came with a side of potato salad which I did try.  I liked it, but felt it needed salt-a lot of it.

I spit the first bite of my burger out because it was so gross, then I took the bun off and there was a short light hair in the chili. I told the waitress (Her name was Courtney) and she took it. I then told her I just wanted some chili fries instead and she informed me that they wouldn't be free. Well yeah, I know that, I didn't really expect them to be. I told her that's fine but to make sure we don't pay for the burger. That is when she went from being overly nice (so fake) to a complete bitch. She said \\\" Well of course you do... I mean its not our fault there was a hair in it.\\\" Yes, it is. It's exactly your fault. I told her I wasn't paying for a burger with hair in it and she argued with us for a while, then she took the burger to the bar and all the employees came out and loudly picked at it and tried to find the hair. They must have found it because she decided not to charge for the overpriced burger. The service and food was disgusting. I was scared to even eat my chili fries because they seemed like the type of people to spit in your food if you piss them off. It was gross anyway though and I ended up leaving most of it. I honestly can not believe this place is still in business.... You can only pay with cash. And there's only two non-alcoholic drink options... a glass bottle of coke and bottled water.

            "input": "Tried this place for the first time with a couple friends for lunch on a Sunday. Had a good experience, friendly service and our waiter made several recommendations. The live music was a bonus! I  agree with other reviews on price point; however, this is not traditional Mexican food so perhaps in that viewpoint, pricing is expected? We didn't order off the Sunday brunch menu which looked to be more affordable, but everything we did order was delicious: \\n\\nLibations: The Bloody Mary was so good, not too overpowering or spicy.  The glass was rimmed with salt and what looked/tasted like sugar and crushed red pepper, not spicy at all, a nice touch.  I also tried a Michelada for the first time, another good choice! Would like to try happy hour (drinks are half off) on another visit.\\n\\nStarters: The complimentary bread basket with Olive Tapenade set the tone for a non-traditional Mexican meal. But we also ordered an appetizer, the Kuali de Cameron which was my favorite. Think fancy shrimp tostadas...a large shrimp atop a roasted jalape\\u00f1o dressed with a couple of different cheeses and seasoned very well! Would like to try the guacamole raved by other yelpers next time for sure!\\n\\nMain event: We ordered a couple dishes for sharing, the Tacos Cochinita Pibil (pulled pork) was very tasty; the meat was juicy and flavorful. The enchiladas suizas was traditional with the exception of chorizo crumbled on top, otherwise not really too exciting for my palate. \\n\\nGrand finale: After little debate and then a vote, we decided to go with the Flan for dessert. The flan itself was okay; however, the candied pecans and the fresh-cut strawberries on the side with Khalua cream and caramel heavily drizzled on top added more character to this dessert. There was also another distinct taste like goat cheese and when we asked the waiter he mentioned its cajetas (goat milk in the caramel sauce), all flavors blended nicely together to end a good meal :)",

The meat, although it was not hopelessly adhered to the bone, meat itself was very hard, dry, like it was baked in the oven for hours without fluids.  The meat was very very bland.  I asked for extra gravy but the gravy was not at all tasty and did not improve the meat.  It was so horrid, ICK!   I had also ordered a $3 caesar salad, but the salad, tho tasty, was also very small in portion.  \\n\\nI ate alone.  \\n\\nI was so disappointed.  I could not see myself getting through that osso bucco, so the waitress took it away.  She offered to not charge me, but I already out the moneyh for the Groupon.  I could not find anything else on the small dinner menu to use up my $20.  The manager came to talk to me.  He said all the pork shanks were the same, and he would not be able to find me a less dry piece.  I never sent back osso bucco before, but I did this one.  I got talked into the spaghetti squash for $19.95, with scampi cream sauce and 4 large shrimp.  It tasted much better than the osso bucco, but I felt the shrimp was hard , audibly crunchy even tho it was not fried, and overdone.  It is not anything I would order again.\\n\\nThe restaurant also was sooooo noisy, as soon as I walked in there I was overwhelmed with such a roar of noise.   Nothing in the decor dampens the sound, all hard surfaces.  I sat outside on the patio, which had less of a roar.  \\n\\nI am giving it a 2 star instead of one, because the service was not rude, it was not the waitress's fault I didn't like the osso bucco, and the manager did come to talk to me about the osso bucco and how they \\\"braise\\\" it and tried to help me find something else on the menu, and he did take the $3 salad off my bill.  \\n\\nI do not drink wine so cannot comment on that.

I watched him stand up front and eat off of the hostess' plate--at the front of the restaurant...in plain sight of everyone there!, pour himself a glass of wine, and stomp to the back to work at his computer. I also overheard him cursing while in a conversation with another table--who, by the way, he made a point of saying \\\"you guys stay as long as you want.

Now we're business owners. To me, this is unacceptable crap even at fast food restaurant. If I'm going to drop a couple hundred dollars on dinner, I want exceptional food....and service.

This has got to be why it doesn't smell like a fat sweaty trucker (ahem MacDonalds) when you walk in the door, it actually smells like delicious appetizing food! So price and Quality are Tops.\\n\\nThe SERVICE is always atypically friendly, Its like they hire former Disney Characters, Im pretty sure they are like glowing sparkle Fairys or perhaps some other form of semi- Magical people. You just don't get 'tude here, ever. EVER.\\nSo staff is excellent. \\n\\nCLEANLINESS is one of my hang ups, I can spot a speck of ketchup on a wall at 50 yards, or a dust fragment from space, But at this particular  In-N-Out Location, I know they have seriously high scrutiny for cleanliness. My last visit was just yesterday and they had a supervisor literally giving the wallpaper the ol' White Glove treatment, scouring the place for any specks of dirt, lifting up the fake plants and looking under the bins of salt & pepper packages, even searching the window shades for any sign of dirt. The folks behind the counter had White, clean aprons on and the whole place just gleamed with cleanliness. LOVE.\\n\\n In-N-Out will you marry me?",

As this library is right up my alley, I love coming here to both browse and read, and while it isn't a good as UNLV's Lied Library back when I was a student, it's still a very solid and nice library.\\n\\nFor starters, the actual \\\"library\\\" is just part of the facility itself.  There is a used bookstore, meeting halls and they occasionally have (albeit small\\\" art exhibits.  The place is very large for a Clark County library.\\n\\nThey have not just a wide selection of books, but also of other multimedia like music and film.  Way back when, the only kinds of movies you could find would either be very old classics or documentaries, now you can find anything from blockbuster films to pro wrestling DVDs (yes, you read that right).  \\n\\nWhen I first started coming here in middle school, they had a physical circulation desk.  Now, everything is automated.  This can be a good or bad thing based on your personal preferences, but it's a good display of evolving the library.  There are quite a few study rooms for when you are cramming for exams, and there are several good reading areas that are relatively secluded from the high traffic walkways.  This is where I usually go when I want to do some reading outside of my house, and there are few things more relaxing than going here and plunging into a good book with some jazz on my iPod.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, due to the recession and cuts to public institutions, the library has severely cut their hours.  It used to be open until 9 Monday through Thursday, now it's until 6.  By comparison, UNLV's Lied Library is open until midnight Mon-Thurs, so I am a bit spoiled by it back when I was a student.  Secondly, the Wi-Fi in the library moves like Rush Hour traffic on the 95.  If you're coming here to do work on a laptop, be patient, or find a Starbucks to work at.  \\n\\nThe West Sahara Library is one of the better Clark County Libraries, and it's a great place to not just check out material but to just read inside.\\n\\nPROS:\\nLarge, contains more than just a library\\nAutomated checkout and book returns\\nCozy reading areas\\nVery little annoying cell phone use\\n\\nCONS:\\nVery slow Wi-Fi\\nCut business hours\\n\\nTHE VERDICT:  Great library, will consistently use it.",

The little cakes were bland and dry. The chocolate mousse was surprisingly not sweet enough. The tapioca had a bitter orange layer on top that tasted worse the more I ate it.

We ordered multiple pieces of furniture, including a custom sectional. The couch arrived with one of the pieces of furniture made with the wrong fabric.

Also, the driver tripped on his way in the house ripping the fabric on another piece-- it has still not been replaced.\\n\\nBefore I received this bad service I made the mistake of recommending them to my parents. They told my parents the drivers would call a half hour before they arrived to deliver their furniture-- it didn't happen, they just showed up.

I went back to Verizon and they simply plugged it in, and restarted it, and the phone turned on and was working fine. Verizon said the phone didn't appear to have any problems and was confused about why the Apple Genius would have told me such things. I almost paid $200 to get another phone!

My friends and I had breakfast here,and ordered the pho dac bi\\u00e8t and b\\u00fan t\\u00ect n\\u00fa\\u00f3ng. One friend wanted the pho ga as well as the pho dac bi\\u00e8t, so she ended up asking if she could have the pho dac bi\\u00e8t with the t\\u00ect ga in it and they were more than obliged to do so! My other friend ordered the bun t\\u00ect n\\u00fa\\u00f3ng but they gave her chicken instead of the beef. My friend not being so picky ended up eating the dish, which turned out to be pretty good.  The table adjacent to us ended up getting her dish instead. The waiters knew they made a mistake as did we and surprisingly acknowledged their mistake, which is always great and rare for any pho restaurant to do. Good thing we're not picky eaters, plus we were on a time crunch so we were more interested in eating and going.  Our food came with a good amount of meat so it turned out to be very filling.  I do believe the dishes are priced a little high but since I did not see too many other pho restaurants I guess competition is scarce.  All in all a good place for Vietnamese food, almost like home cooking.  I enjoy eating off the Vegas strip.",

We dressed casual. \\n\\nEverything was excellent here.  I tried the fois gras sliders - Out of this world! It was the first time I tried fois gras, and it was authentic, and excellent quality. The burgers were awesome. \\n\\nMy guest loved her food, but I can't remember what she ordered, but she loved it.\\n\\nWe tried the famous mashed potatoes.. and let me tell you..  It was like eating butter! It was so soft!  The flavor was awesome as well.  \\n\\nThe french fries were extremely good. Maybe the best fries I've ever had, and I LOVE FRENCH FRIES!! They were very crispy, and good texture. Flavorful, and salted just right.  YUM!\\n\\nI tried the \\\"steak tartare\\\" but did not like it. I never had it before, but the taste was rich, and I did not like it. It was like eating dog food to me..  They took it off the bill. \\n\\nI tried the baby lamb chops.. and let me tell you.. These were the most tender lamb chops I've ever had.   They were awesome! Tiny, but awesome!  Kind of like a wagyu lamb chop!  They were seasoned good as well.  I recommend this!\\n\\nfor dessert we had the souffle. It was small, served in a thin glass. It was authentic, and good. \\n\\nIt's rare for me to love so many things at a restaurant, and this was one of the best meals, if not the best meal, I've ever had. \\n\\nIt was expensive, and even though the timeshare presentation was about 4 hours all said and done... this meal made it worth it!",

Towards the end of the meal when the waitress came over I just discreetly told her I didn't get the chicken and they took it off the bill.\\n\\nSo overall it was a nice meal but I prefer Sapporo in Scottsdale for Teppanyaki.",

I also tried the cucumber lemonade which was quite good. Overall the service was attentive and our food came out promptly. My coworker had the seared tuna sliders and sweet potato hash which he looked pleased with. The portions were perfect for what we were in the mood for which was just something really light. It's a great place for lunch, the ambiance is nice especially if you're sitting on the patio.

There is a real warm genuine atmosphere to the place that allows the customers to leave their cares and the anxieties of the day at the door and enjoy themselves freely in the company of old and new found friends.

Yeah...that was it! \\n\\nOutside of that, very friendly staff and a generally clean establishment. I ordered the nachos and they were ok. Nothing to brag about by any means. Just ok. I'd probably visit this location again on a whim, but that's about it. Overall good experience.",

            "input": "I rated this 3.5 stars and only rounded down since I did realize I don't usually go to have pho here, or anywhere, on my own usually. Only when friends want to go. It's not that I don't think pho is good food. It's just that I have so many other favorites that rank above it, so sue me hehe. That said, I have tried pho at alot of places but I've been here the most. That partly is due to its proximity to the Strip and being open 24hrs. Who am I kidding, those ARE the main reasons I've patronized this pho establishment more than any other pho spot. Friends visiting out of town, want late night eats nearby after gambling and/or partying all day/night. \\nI remember when it wasn't open late. Then it seemed like every year or 2 the closing time became 1hr later, next thing I know it's 24hrs! Pho spots are notorious for their horrible service. Although the last time I went recently the service was horrible. The pho came with a lemon wedge instead of limes and I got exactly one basil thai stem. And we could never find our waiter and ended up having 3 separate waiters help us. Besides that, the service has been pretty decent here. The broth doesn't taste noticeably better or worse than any of the other pho's I've had. I do get a little annoyed everytime I get my pho, the rare steak on top is already fully cooked from the heat of the broth. I should probably follow my one friend's lead and ask for the meat on the side so that doesn't happen but I always forget.\\nIf you eat at the hours I do, there probably is not many other options but during normal times when people eat, there are alot of pho choices scattered along Spring Mountain Road in Chinatown. I think it's a decent place for pho and it helps that you never have to worry if it's closed.",

After having a great time the night before, we wanted to continue the celebrations over brunch. After 30 minutes of waiting for a table, we then waited another 30-45mins before we were able to order food! This type of service is understandable if it is crowded, but it was not. There were many open tables. When we brought it up to our waiter, his excuse was \\\"Well the kitchen is on the second floor so we are running up and down stairs\\\". If this is what causes the bad service, then something needs to be fixed! \\n\\nBesides the wait, the food was okay. Definitely not the a top choice for brunches in Las Vegas and I don't think I will be back anytime soon.",

The person who answered the phone very angrily told me that \\\"we are closed, and I am on camelback so I can't talk to you.\\\" I then told him that he should maybe change his signs to say closed, instead of getting angry when a customer calls him, and then he hung up on me.

Although the one is Mesa is closer to my house and the food the same quality, I prefer the ambiance of this one better so my husband and I always try to stop by when in the area.  \\n\\nI'l admit I'm not very adventurous when eating new things at times.  I find a favorite and stick to it.  I have tried about 5 different pasties but my favorites I always come back to are the Oggie and Chicken Pot Pie.  Their soups are also wonderful.  The potato leek is very hearty and filling but the Mushroom, Walnut and Spinach was a wonderful surprise.  I would never have tried it because it seemed and odd mix of flavors but I saw an episode of \\\"Check Please AZ\\\" where this soup was raved about so I decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did!  The complexity of flavors was out of this world.\\n\\nA huge beer and a warm pasty, the casual atmosphere and aroma of the mouth watering red wine gravy all blend into a wonderful dining experience.
