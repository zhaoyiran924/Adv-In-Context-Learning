If you have someone in your family who's had cancer you do worry about having it and if you have a negative test it allays that anxiety and that's a really big thing.\n\"Secondly, there are now drugs that are particularly effective for people who have breast cancer and have the BRCA1 or 2 mutation.\n\"This type of personalised medicine, as we call it, does make a difference.\"\nDr Butler, who runs the genetic testing laboratory, said demand was \"huge\" for the test and that the laboratory had seen a \"surge\" in women coming to them wanting it following the publicity surrounding Angelina Jolie's surgery.\nThe 37-year-old film star revealed in May that she was told by doctors that she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer without the radical treatment because of genes she inherited from her mother.\n\"The Angelina Jolie effect is definitely a good thing as people are now talking about it,\" said Dr Butler.\n\"But there are patients who come in to see us and for the counselling we offer and even if we work out that they do not meet the current strict criteria, they still want the test and will pay for it privately instead.\"\nIn June, new National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidelines were published which loosened the eligibility criteria for genetic testing of the BRCA cancer gene in England and Wales.\nIt means somebody who has a family member diagnosed before the age of 50 could be eligible for the test. Previously, they had to have two relatives diagnosed before the age of 50.\nThe Welsh government said it was working to make the tests available for more patients on the NHS.\n\"Advances in technology (such as next generation sequencing) and new treatment options mean that potentially there is benefit in wider testing for some breast cancer patients,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"Testing is becoming cheaper and quicker, and there could be advantages in lowering the threshold for testing.\n\"This will result in a reduction in the percentage of BRCA-positive women identified, but this would be outweighed by the benefits to those additional women identified who could be eligible to access personalised treatment options.\n\"This type of stratified medicine approach is being discussed in Wales and in England.\"", "output": "The number of people being offered a breast cancer genetic test on the Welsh NHS could treble within the next few years, a leading expert says.", "explanation": "This is a good example.

Instead, it is made of a thin layer of transparent quartz coated in millions of tiny pillars, each just tens of nanometres  across and hundreds high.\nSingly, each pillar interacts strongly with light. Their combined effect is to slice up a light beam and remould it as the rays pass through the array (see video below).\nComputer calculations are needed to find the exact pattern which will replicate the focussing effect of a conventional lens.\nThe advantage, Prof Capasso said, is that these \"metalenses\" avoid shortfalls - called aberrations - that are inherent in traditional glass optics.\n\"The quality of our images is actually better than with a state-of-the-art objective lens. I think it is no exaggeration to say that this is potentially revolutionary.\"\nThose comparisons were made against top-end lenses used in research microscopes, designed to achieve absolute maximum magnification. The focal spot of the flat lens was typically 30% sharper than its competition, meaning that in a lab setting, finer details can be revealed.\nBut the technology could be revolutionary for another reason, Prof Capasso maintains.\n\"The conventional fabrication of shaped lenses depends on moulding and essentially goes back to 19th Century technology.\n\"But our lenses, being planar, can be fabricated in the same foundries that make computer chips. So all of a sudden the factories that make integrated circuits can make our lenses.\"\nAnd with ease. Electronics manufacturers making microprocessors and memory chips routinely craft components far smaller than the pillars in the flat lenses. Yet a memory chip containing billions of components may cost just a few pounds.\nMass production is the key to managing costs, which is why Prof Capasso sees cell-phone cameras as an obvious target. Most of their other components, including the camera's detector, are already made with chip technology. Extending that to include the lens would be natural, he argues.\nThere are many other potential uses: mass-produced cameras for quality control in factories, light-weight optics for virtual-reality headsets, even contact lenses. \"We can make these on soft materials,\" Prof Capasso assured the BBC.\nThe prototypes lenses are 2mm across, but only because of the limitations of the Harvard manufacturing equipment. In principle, the method could scale to any size, Prof Capasso said.\n\"Once you have the foundry - you want a 12-inch lens? Feel free, you can make a 12-inch lens. There's no limit.\"\nThe precise character of the lens depends on the layout and composition of the pillars. Paint-whitener - titanium dioxide - is used to make the pillars, because it is transparent and interacts strongly with visible light. It is also cheap.\nThe team has previously worked with silicon, which functions well in the infrared. Other materials could be used to make ultraviolet lenses.\nOr to get a different focus, engineers could change the size, spacing and orientation of the pillars. It simply means doing the computer calculations and dialling the results into the new design.\nThe team is already working on beating the performance of its first prototypes. Watch this space, they say - if possible, with a pair of metalenses.", "output": "Just 2mm across and finer than a human hair, the tiny device can magnify nanoscale objects and gives a sharper focus than top-end microscope lenses.

There is much we northern parents can learn about this parent power.\"\nMs Longfield told the newspaper that although the \"tiger\" parents of London and the south-east had been mocked for their emphasis on extra homework and music lessons, there was something to be learned from the way they demanded more from teachers and schools for their children.\nHighlights of the research include:\nThe research heralds a Growing Up North project which will investigate why some children in the north fall behind.\nAt the launch of the project, the Commissioner is expected to call for the regeneration under way in the north of England to focus on reshaping the prospects of all children in the region to put them on a par with those in the south.\nA north-south divide, particularly in secondary schools, was highlighted by Ofsted in its annual report on Thursday last week.\nIn the report, England's chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, said poorly performing schools in the north and the East Midlands continued to fuel the sense of a divided nation.", "output": ["Parents in the north of England should learn from their pushier counterparts in the south to help their children get top grades, says the children's tsar."]}, {"id": "task1290-b8f4f59a38cc4b24bd6d77a849fae419", "input": "Simonstone Hall in the Yorkshire Dales shared a picture of the plaque, donated by a hotel guest, on Facebook.\n\"Here lies the BBC career of Jeremy Clarkson who had a fracas on this spot, 4 March 2015,\" reads the plaque. \"The rest is legend.\"\nClarkson was suspended, then dropped, by the BBC following the incident.\nThe Top Gear team were staying at the hotel during filming when Irish producer Oisin Tymon was assaulted by Clarkson during a late-night argument over food.\nTymon suffered swelling and a split lip and visited a hospital for his injuries.\nFollowing an internal investigation, the BBC announced Clarkson's contract on Top Gear would not be renewed.\n\"We were presented with this plaque from one of our guests last night!\" wrote Simonstone Hall, sharing a picture on social media.\n\"We think it would be quite appropriate to put it on the patio where the fracas took place!\"\nEarlier this month it was revealed Tymon is suing Clarkson and the BBC for racial discrimination, centring on \"verbal abuse\" he said he received from the presenter during the fracas.\nClarkson will front a new show on Amazon Prime with co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond in the New Year, while Chris Evans will host the new look Top Gear when it returns for a new series.", "output": ["The scene of Jeremy Clarkson's infamous fracas with a BBC Top Gear producer has been commemorated with a plaque at the hotel where the altercation took place."]}, {"id": "task1290-303db8cd21ee46659b0ba95a3ced8d18", "input": "Because by giving the Qatari capital the chance to stage a week of running, jumping and throwing, the governing body had to let them do it away from the blast furnace that is the Gulf state's summer.\nThis means \"the world's third biggest sports event\" will start on the last weekend of September, in the middle of Japan's hosting of the Rugby World Cup, which itself claims to be the \"third biggest sports event in the world\".\nSuddenly it all makes sense. The IAAF's 27 voters were not influenced by Qatar's offer to cough up the prize money, bring in an as yet unnamed new sponsor and build 10 tracks at deserving locations. They just wanted to settle, once and for all, who gets sport's bronze medal in the mega-event stakes.\nWhich they will do, just as soon as they work out a way to go head-to-head with the Asian Games, the Champions League, the European Football Championship, the Paralympics, the Ryder Cup, the Super Bowl and every other event that has claimed to be third only in size, significance or some mix of the two, to the Summer Olympics and World Cup.\n\"Everyone knows the Olympics and World Cup are the two biggest sporting events in terms of interest and media coverage,\" explained Professor Simon Shibli, the head of Sheffield Hallam University's Sport Industry Research Centre.\n\"The best other events can hope to be is 'third biggest' and this provides a considerable unique selling point when it comes to maximising commercial rights.\n\"By claiming to be the third biggest, promoters position themselves above all other events and create the illusion they are in the same league as the big two. This is very seductive for would-be commercial partners and public-sector bodies.\"\nOr, as the man who brought the Tour de France to Yorkshire, put it: \"Saying you're the 11th biggest event in the world just lacks 'wow'.\"\nAnd that was not a message Gary Verity could take to the region's local authorities when he passed the metaphorical cloth cap around for contributions to the Grand Depart's \u00a327m budget.\n\"What got the councils excited was that it is cycling's biggest event, it is unique, relatively cheap and it was outrageously ambitious,\" said the man who has spent the last five months collecting awards for pulling it off.\nVerity got his money, eventually, because he was able to look councillors in Harrogate, Holmfirth and Huddersfield in the eye and say this French bike race is the biggest event Yorkshire can ever hope to stage.\nThe Rugby World Cup's pitch is based on a combination of the number of participating nations, its television audience and the number of tickets it sells.\nIf you take those individually, it barely makes the top 10 for participants or ratings. Only for paid-up spectators will the 2015 RWC get near the medals, with its projected 2.3m tickets sold close to the London Paralympics' 2.7m.\n\"It is the third biggest global event of an international flavour,\" clarified World Rugby chief executive Brett Gosper in London last month, ranking it behind a \"combined Olympics\" and football's World Cup.\n\"It's a big one, alright, and it's getting bigger.\"\nWhether he meant a combined Summer and Winter Olympics, which are different events, or a combined Summer Olympics and Paralympics, which are also different events, was unclear, but he was on a roll and it seemed rude to interrupt.\nHis answer, however, revealed how complicated this third biggest business is: how do you define big? And what is an event?\nFor Gosper, the Rugby World Cup is the culmination of a series of qualifying events over four years. So his count includes the 102 countries that entered qualification for the 2015 tournament.\nBut does that mean football's Champions League final should be viewed as the last act in a 10-month play? Is the Super Bowl the last day of a single five-month event that dominates US conversation like nothing outside of a presidential election?\n\"The problem we have is that we are comparing apples, oranges, pears and coconuts,\" explained Mike Laflin, the chief executive of the sports business analysis firm Sportcal.\n\"All the measurements are made by the relevant sports bodies themselves, so there is no uniformity.\n\"You end up with a lot of rhetoric about an event's economic impact, but most of us don't believe the numbers so there is also a lack of credibility.\"\nNowhere is that credibility more stretched than in the fantasy world of TV figures.\nLet us take the Rugby World Cup's claim of a cumulative global TV audience of 4.2bn as an example.\nThat is 87.5m per game, which is going some for a sport with only 3,000 registered players in China, 24,000 in India, 670 in Indonesia, 16,000 in Brazil, 7,000 in Pakistan, 800 in Nigeria and an unknown figure for Bangladesh - so that is 51,470 players in countries that make up half of the world's population.\nAsked to explain how a sport with patchy global appeal can generate such huge audiences, World Rugby's Alan Gilpin, who heads up organisation of the World Cup, said more than 20,000 hours would be broadcast from next year's tournament to 200 countries, including, for the first time, Greenland (population 56,483).\nWhen pushed for more detail on this, Gilpin said, whilst fighting a smile: \"It is based on the number of segments people watch, and that is the same metric everybody else uses.\"\nA segment, in case you are wondering, is somebody watching for 20 minutes, so it is possible that 25m people could deliver an audience of 100m. That still seems far-fetched for Tonga versus Georgia.\nBut Gilpin is right: everybody is at it. The last big football tournament in this country, Euro 96, claimed an audience of 6.7bn, the Tour de France talks about its 3.5bn viewers and some of the more excitable Chinese sources suggested as many as 4bn watched the opening ceremony of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.\n\"We need an agreed framework of what is meant by TV audiences and to apply it consistently,\" said Sheffield Hallam's Shibli.\n\"There has been a lot of bravado in the battle to be the world's third biggest sports event, and TV audiences have been stretched to the point of being ludicrous.\n\"We now routinely get estimates of how many households a broadcast can reach, rather than how many people actually watched it.  Other tenuous inclusions feature coverage on news programmes and in-flight entertainment on aeroplanes!\"\nYou could argue there is no harm done if everybody is doing it, but Sportcal's Laflin thinks harm is being done to sport's inherent value.\n\"We need a better way to sell these events than just these figures that nobody really believes,\" he explained.\n\"These events are actually undervalued because sport doesn't understand its product very well.\n\"We should focus more on the social benefits, national pride, volunteers, that kind of thing. The 2011 Rugby World Cup had huge intangible benefits for New Zealand.\n\"Ask London or Vancouver if they would have the Olympics back - of course they would!\"\nThis \"more holistic approach\" to measuring size is behind Laflin's Global Sports Impact (GSI) project.\nMore than 200 experts were asked to come up with a list of the most important factors in ranking an event - tickets sold, tourists attracted, media impact and so on - and these were applied to 700 events over a 12-year period.\nThe results are fascinating, as the 2011 Rugby World Cup is ranked fourth, behind London's Olympics, the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and 2012 Paralympics. So Gosper was on to something.\nThe IAAF will be less happy, though, as the 2013 Worlds in Moscow are down in 11th, sandwiched between this year's Asian Games in South Korea and the Youth Olympic Games in China.\nWhile it is fun to puncture a few puffed-up claims, there is a serious point.\nWith western democracies increasingly reluctant to put up the cash required to win bids for big sporting events, there is a danger they will give up, leaving the field clear for politicians from countries where they are less worried about things like elections.\nClearly, there are benefits for sport in dealing with nations that can stage events without too many questions, particularly if they happen to be wealthy, but nobody wants these bidding contests to become walkovers.\nIt is something Simon Morton spends a long time pondering. As the boss of the team at UK Sport that uses National Lottery money to bid for world-class events, Morton needs to know where the value is.\n\"The global market for sports events is quite immature, which can be a bad thing in that there are some real turkeys out there, but also an opportunity because you can pick up some bargains,\" said Morton, who has secured 10 world or European-level events between now and the Rio Olympics in 2016.\n\"But we don't talk about size so much, we talk about strategic value to the UK, and on that basis we are delighted to have won the bid to stage the World Athletics Championships in 2017.\n\"This concept of biggest can be misleading. We look for public engagement, how it will benefit our elite performers and what the event's legacy will be. They are things we can measure.\"\nSo perhaps size is not important, after all, and what really matters is not how big your event is, but what you do with it.\nThat said, it can only be a matter of time before people start arguing about which event has the third best legacy.", "output": ["The International Association of Athletics Federations might have broken Eugene's heart and bemused Barcelona by deciding Doha's late \u00a323.5m \"incentive\" had given it the edge in the contest to stage the 2019 World Athletics Championships, but it did the rest of us a great service."]}, {"id": "task1290-fbbde4bfa249479b812edd1eca175a79", "input": "Another five soldiers were wounded in a rocket attack on Turkish tanks, the military said in a statement.\nThe fatalities are believed to be the first since Turkey launched its operation inside Syria two weeks ago.\nTwo fighters from the Free Syrian Army were also killed and another two injured in the attack.\n\"Two of our hero comrades were martyred and five were wounded in a rocket attack on two of our tanks by Daesh (IS) elements,\" the army statement said.\nThe rocket attack was launched near the village of al-Waqf, it added.\nSyrian rebels backed by Turkey say they have recaptured a number of villages from IS since the Turkish operation - code-named Euphrates Shield - began.\nThe rebels have also retaken the key border town of Jarabulus.\nOn Sunday, Turkey said IS fighters were pushed out of their last positions along the Turkish-Syrian border.\nTurkish forces have targeted IS inside Syria, but have also attacked Kurdish fighters in the same region.\nThe pursuit of the Kurdish YPG militia has led to criticism by Washington, which regards the Kurds as one of the most effective forces in the battle against IS.", "output": ["Two Turkish soldiers have been killed by the Islamic State (IS) group in clashes in northern Syria, the Turkish army has said."]}, {"id": "task1290-620ffa8b53d347f8891205f0a08ee16a", "input": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe 21-year-old, who upset fifth seed Stan Wawrinka on Monday, lost 6-4 6-2 3-6 2-6 6-3 to Belgian Ruben Bemelmans.\nThe Russian led 2-0 in the decider but became angry at Alves' decisions as he lost five straight games and was docked a point by the umpire.\n\"I was just frustrated - it has no meaning, I apologise,\" said Medvedev.\nAs he was packing up, Medvedev took out his wallet and threw coins at the bottom of the umpire's chair as Alves departed.

It was a great decision to move him up to number six and you can see the confidence that has given him.\nStokes was outstanding on Saturday. He was solid in defence but still positive and played good, well-controlled shots.\nHe deserved a hundred and looked utterly crestfallen when he played on off the bowling of Mitchell Marsh for 87.\nWhen England took the field later in the day, Stokes was like a dynamo. He is whole-hearted and chases and dives after everything.\nThe one area where he is still a work in progress is his bowling.\nHe often gets compared to Andrew Flintoff, and he is probably already a better batsman than England's 2005 hero but he's some way off being the bowler Flintoff was.\nAt the moment he's a fourth seamer who still bowls a bad ball every over, but if he can work on his consistency without losing any pace, he could become a really top all-rounder.\nIf Stokes looked frustrated to miss out on a hundred, then Alastair Cook looked mortified when he chopped on for 96.\nWhen he drove at a wide-ish ball from Marsh, he must have thought he'd struck a boundary, but instead the ball caught the inside edge and Cook was gone. That shows the tiny margins there are in this game.\nIt was an excellent innings nonetheless, compiled using precisely the cautious-but-confident approach Cook adopts when he's at his best.\nWe've heard all about England's new positive style, and there were signs in Cardiff that Cook was trying to follow the trend by being more attacking, but this was the old Cook, and that's the Cook England need.\nFrom the horrors of 30-4, England could not have done much more than reaching 312 all out.\nAustralia stuck to their task well, bowled mostly full lengths to attacking fields, and gradually chipped away at the England innings.\nMarsh now has a real opportunity to cement his place in this team for a long time. He ran in with much more purpose than Shane Watson has been doing and looked like a bowler who wanted to take wickets.\nWatson used to bowl ball after ball outside the off stump, which was occasionally effective, but his body language was poor in Cardiff and Marsh looks much more sprightly.\nI wasn't at all surprised that Australia didn't enforce the follow-on. They might have thought about it if they'd blown England out in an hour and a half this morning, but the pitch is slow and flat so Michael Clarke needed to give his bowlers a rest.\nEngland are likely to have to survive the best part of five sessions to save the game, but I see no reason why they shouldn't be able to do it.\nThe ball is not doing anything at all. It hasn't spun and even if it does spin it will do so very slowly and without bounce.\nIt's a slow, true pitch and there's no real bounce to terrify the lower order so if England play every ball very carefully they can save this match.\nThe safety-first approach won't come naturally to a lot of the current England players. Modern batsmen like to see scoreboard ticking along. There aren't many Geoff Boycotts out there who are happy blocking ball after ball.\nBut this Test is there for the saving.

What impact might that have in Northern Ireland?\nThey are effectively a means-tested benefit paid to people on lower incomes. They are paid to two main groups: unemployed people with children and low paid working people who may or may not have children.\nThey are perhaps popularly thought of as a state top-up for low paid working people. There are two types of tax credit: Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit - it is the latter that seems likely to be cut.\nIt is paid at a maximum rate of \u00a32,780 per child per year and you are entitled to the full amount until your annual income reaches just over \u00a316,000. Then, there is a formula that sees the amount you get taper away as your income rises. It also depends on the size of your family.\nIt is a significant number - on the most recent figures there are 140,000 families in Northern Ireland who get child tax credits. About 89,000 are families where someone is working. If we look at working families who only claim the child element of tax credits, it is worth on average \u00a34,000 a year. So we are talking about a significant payment to a large number of people.\nThe government has promised to cut \u00a312bn from the benefits bill and has not left very much room for manoeuvre. Before the election David Cameron said he would not touch pensioner benefits, which is the largest part of the benefits bill. He also said he would not make any more changes to child benefit.\nAfter that, there are only three areas of spending where you could find savings that are big enough: disability benefits, housing benefits and tax credits.\nIn June, Newsnight reported that the government was considering cutting child tax credits back to the level they were at in 2004 which, by my calculation, means the maximum amount per child would drop from \u00a32,780 to less than \u00a32,000.\nTax credits are, as the name suggests, a tax matter controlled by HM Revenue and Customs.

How important is it to bring in new work?\nIt's a very important thing. The thing about choosing the first play is that it's ridiculously symbolic. I've had this play for a while. It's got so many people in it, it's been hard to find somewhere to do it.\nIt's political, funny and thought-provoking and has a big, strong youth aspect. It reflects so many of the things I care about.\nWhat does it mean to you to be able to premiere Groundhog Day at the Old Vic?\nI was developing it beforehand. We didn't know where it was going to go. I thought that what we were really making was an intelligent, mainstream Broadway musical, with a lot in common with The Music Man and Our Town as American fables.\nIt needs a large audience and a large stage, and I wanted to start it in this country, so it's the perfect match.\nDo you feel extra pressure after your success with Matilda?\nMaking a new musical is a mountain to climb, and each time you say \"That's the last one, I'm not going to do it anymore.\" They are hard enough to do without added expectations.\nThey're so hard that actually a lot of the time, you don't think about the audiences or critics. You think of something much more immediate, problems like the scene or the set.\nYou can't predict how much people will like it, but what we can do is make the story have integrity. It's absolutely possible it could be a flop.\nIf you're worried about whether something succeed or fails, then don't even start on it. You have to have a bigger reason for doing it.\nWhat's your thinking behind your \u00c2\u00a310 preview ticket scheme?\nWhat I'm interested in is removing the obstacle of affordability for people who think they might be inclined to try out theatre.\nI'm not somebody who says that everybody has to love theatre, any more than everybody has to love football, but some people could form a really meaningful relationship with theatre and haven't because of the ticket price.\nWe've got to remove that. We've got make the experience feel less posh.\nHow do you think your approach will differ from Kevin Spacey's?\nIt will differ enormously in some respects and not at all in others. While he's been head of the building he's had an enormous number of people helping him, and those people are still here. So how the theatre functions is unchanged on many levels.\nI'll be pretty much invisible. I'm a director - I like hiding behind other people.\nBut there will be glamour as well, because there will be a lot of star actors passing though the theatre.\n[Kevin] could shake somebody's hand and get them to write a cheque. I can't do that, but they'll write a cheque for my ideas that I'm pitching or because Ralph Fiennes or Tim Spall is standing next to me.\nIt's funny because people used to to say: \"How can a Hollywood actor run a theatre?\" Last night people were asking if I was nervous about taking over from Kevin.

In the month before his death, Woodroof told screenwriter Craig Borten his story for a film that would ultimately take almost 20 years to get made.\nDallas Buyers Club refers to the private members' group that Woodroof and fellow Aids patient Rayon, an invented transgender character played by Jared Leto, established in order to provide alternative - and unauthorised - treatments sourced from abroad.

McConaughey \"chewed a lot of ice\" while he got himself down to 10 stone for the majority of the shoot.\n\"I did it in as healthy a way as I found possible,\" he says.\n\"I met with a nutritionist. I gave myself four months to lose the weight. I had my programmed meals, lost 3.5lb a week - like clockwork - and got down to my desired weight, which turned out to be 47lb lighter.\"\nWere there any unexpected side effects?\n\"The surprise was how the energy that I lost from the neck down transferred to the neck up. I became clinically aware, almost hyper, I needed three hours less sleep a night.\n\"I had an amazing amount of energy from the head up. That was something I didn't know was going to happen.\"\nAccording to McConaughey, a similar thing had happened to Ron. \"His body was withering away, but from the neck up he was like a starving baby eagle  - and he was just savagely clinging to life. He was literally, and figuratively, hungry.\"\nTo help him get into character, McConaughey had access to Borten's taped interviews with Woodroof. \"He would sound like a medical expert or a scientist, and then he would slip in a conspiracy theory and then he would tell a joke, and then lose his train of thought.\"\nThe actor also met Woodroof's family, who allowed him to read Ron's diary from pre-1985.\n\"There was the man alone on Saturday night before he had HIV, and that was my secret weapon. That gave me the monologue so I could go and have the dialogue [in the film].\n\"His family was very honest with me about who he was. They didn't try to sugar-coat this man.\"\nWith this year's Oscars under a month away, McConaughey - along with actress Amy Adams - is in the unusual position of appearing in two films up for best picture.\nAs well as Dallas Buyers Club he has a scene-stealing turn as a chest-beating stockbroker in The Wolf of Wall Street.

out and burns more rapidly than other vegetation.\nThey believe it has fuelled almost 80% of the largest fires in the American West over the last 10 years.\nResearchers are looking at a range of solutions including using a fungus to attack the grass seed.\nOriginally transported to the US in soils on board ocean-going ships, the noxious, weedy grass continued its journey west in the 1800s with settlers and cattle ranchers.\nThe species gets its name because it grows very early and very quickly and then dies, cheating other varieties out of valuable nutrients.\nIt is widely dispersed throughout the Great Basin of the American West, an area of 600,000 sq km that covers parts of Nevada and Utah, Colorado, Idaho, California and Oregon.\nScientists have long suspected that it played a key role in wildfires but this report is the most definitive evidence yet. Researchers used satellite imagery from Nasa to compare burnt areas with regions where cheatgrass dominates.\nAccording to lead author Dr Jennifer Balch from Pennsylvania State University, the connection between the two was clear.\n\"We were able to pick out this species from space because it dries out earlier than native species,\" she told BBC News.  \"We looked at all the really big fires, all the ones over 100 sq km in size and cheatgrass influenced the majority of those, it's fuelling those really big fires.\"\nOver the period from 2000 to 2009 Dr Balch and her colleagues say that cheatgrass influenced 39 of the 50 largest wildfires.\n\"Cheatgrass promotes fires that are easily ignited, and spread rapidly.\" she said. \"They cover large areas and across this landscape that translates to more frequent fires.\"\nThe research suggests that cheatgrass and fires are in a mutually beneficial relationship.\nMichael Kodas is an author and expert on wildfires in the western US. He agrees that cheatgrass is fire-dependent.\n\"I think the fires are believed to help the cheatgrass outcompete other species and expand its range faster, he told BBC News.  \"Basically the fires help speed the invasion.\"\nMr Kodas argues that the invasive species is extending the fire season across the Great Basin.\n\"Cheatgrass grows and dies earlier in the season,\" he said. \"When native grasses and other plants are greening up and moist, it's already sprouted, spread its seed, and died. So after cheatgrass invades, wildfires can occur earlier in the season, when the native vegetation is still green and unlikely to burn.\"\nScientists are now working on ways of containing the threat and are investigating a range of control methods says Dr Balch.\n\"Strategies can be as brute as mechanical removal or as intricate as introducing a fungus that attacks the seed. There are a lot of folks looking at ways to reduce or eliminate cheatgrass.\"\nThe researchers say that invasive grass species are increasing fires globally, from molasses grass in Hawaii to gamba grass in Australia.\nThe research is published in the journal, Global Change Biology.\nFollow Matt on twitter", "output": ["New research indicates that a species of invasive grass is making wildfires in the western US larger, hotter and more frequent."]}, {"id": "task1290-4d0e3b776f23423fae51aa6a43cb9426", "input": "Wholebake's plans for a second unit in Corwen, near to Ty'n Llidiart estate, were unanimously backed by councillors on Wednesday.\nThe company also wants to create an \"employee well-being unit\" including a gym, showers and changing facilities.\nWholebake, which has a storage unit in Wrexham, makes natural food bakery products and already employs 120.", "output": ["Plans for a \u00a314m food manufacturing plant in Denbighshire which will create 120 new jobs have been approved."]}, {"id": "task1290-dc8aa380a96840ababcdeed145b40f3c", "input": "The Steam Packet Company said this was because the P&O fast craft, which is usually chartered to deal with the busy period in June, will not be available.\nA spokesman said timetable changes mean fewer sailings from Ireland and the UK.\nHe added: \"Given the current situation, we expect to see a reduction in the total number of bikes we will carry.\"\nThe loss of the ship from the Manx fleet next year means fewer sailings from Ireland, Heysham and Liverpool.\n\"The Ben-my-Chree and Manannan [Steam Packet-owned ships] have already been scheduled to operate additional Belfast sailings to accommodate Irish fans heading to the races,\" said ferry chief Mark Woodward.\n\"Adding these extra Irish services means the number of sailings from Heysham and Liverpool is slightly reduced.\n'We will keep looking for a replacement charter and have already approached several companies - none at present has indicated a willingness to release vessels\".", "output": ["There will be fewer sailings available for TT fans during the 2016 motorcycling festival than this year, Isle of Man ferry operators have said."]}, {"id": "task1290-31542fa1f37e40f5ae98ac497c501023", "input": "Yn gynharach fe wnaeth ffynhonellau o Blaid Cymru awgrymu y gallai'r arweinydd herio'r Aelod Seneddol Llafur presennol, Chris Bryant.\nFe wnaeth Theresa May gyhoeddi ei bod yn galw am etholiad cyffredinol ar 8 Mehefin ddydd Mawrth, gydag ASau yn pleidleisio o blaid cynnal yr etholiad ddydd Mercher.\nPe bai Ms Wood yn sefyll ac yn ennill yn y Rhondda, byddai angen isetholiad i'r sedd Cynulliad a gornest am arweinydd newydd i'r blaid.\nEnillodd Ms Wood y sedd yn y Cynulliad yn erbyn Leighton Andrews yn yr etholiad yn 2016.\nWrth siarad ar raglen Good Evening Wales ar BBC Radio Wales ddydd Mercher, dywedodd arweinydd Plaid Cymru nad oedd hi wedi penderfynu y naill ffordd neu'r llall eto.\n\"Rydyn ni'n pwyso a mesur pethau,\" meddai.\n\"Rydyn ni'n gwneud pethau mewn ffordd gyfrifol.

Sometimes you have to move forward and be brave enough to make the decisions.\"\nMichael Vaughan (MV): \"I really think it's sad we won't see Kevin Pietersen playing for England again.\"\nAlec Stewart (AS): \"Now, sadly, it's all come to an end.\"\nEngland lost the winter's Ashes series 5-0 down under, and despite an insistence that there was no split in the party, rumours have circulated that Pietersen was at the centre of a rift in the camp.\nGB: \"Pietersen has to take some responsibility. Some of those shots in Australia were mind-boggling.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMV: \"Only within those four walls [of the dressing room] do you understand what he's been doing. Swann said 10 days ago that Kevin Pietersen has been fine since he was reintegrated in 2012.\"\nAS: \"We don't know exactly what has gone in within that England dressing room. Dressing rooms are difficult places whatever level you play at. Part of managing isn't just coaching, it's about managing players and situations and not allowing things to come to a head.\"\nMV: \"For me, the hardest thing to manage was his haircut! I do think it's about managing these guys, involving them. When you have a maverick you have to keep talking to them, telling them that all the people here at the ground are here to watch them. You try to big them up.\n\"I'd love to think that management takes place, but I clearly think they haven't because he's just been distanced. You could see he was going doolally. He could have been managed in a better way.\"\nGB: \"We all remember his wonderful innings, but what about the daft things and the stupid shots? That has an effect on the dressing room and young players. How do you tell young players to play responsibly? It stops you from building discipline.\"\nAS: \"When England were winning we didn't hear too much about KP doing things right or wrong. As soon as we lose, everyone's now pointing their finger at KP, and I find that unfair and unjust.\"\nEighteen months ago Pietersen was omitted from England's Test squad after admitting criticising captain Andrew Strauss in texts to South African cricketers. He was subsequently 'reintegrated' into the England side - but have the wounds ever fully healed?\nMV: \"If they wanted rid of him, he could have gone in 2012. Textgate was disgraceful - English cricket could have drawn a black line through his name and moved on. But they reintegrated him.\"\nGB: \"When you go back to the South Africa episode, they took him back but I wrote then that a leopard doesn't change its spots. They were always worried that he would go back to playing how he wanted and not how the team wanted.\"\nOn 31 January England technical director Andy Flower announced he was standing down, but Pietersen is the first player to be chopped after the disastrous winter.\nMV: \"KP scored the most runs in the Ashes series - yes, he didn't have a great series, but the ECB need to explain exactly what Pietersen does inside the dressing room that they can't manage any longer. You have to manage mavericks - you can't have clones around you all the time.\"\nAS: \"Has there been a thorough review of what happened and why England were hammered? In most sports, after that the coach goes and I believe the captain's position should be reviewed. A thorough review has to take place so England cricket can move on.\"\nMV: \"It's a very strange decision for England to make. A new director of cricket comes in soon, and he should have his decision to get his team around him. They've made this decision on their star player - they've made the decision now when someone's coming in in a couple of months' time. They can't manage someone like Pietersen, who would have gone in 2015 after the World Cup and the next Ashes?\"\nAS: \"Are we looking to the future? Does that discount Matt Prior and James Anderson, anyone over 30? Or is it just Pietersen?\"\nPietersen, 33, is England's all-time leading run-scorer across all formats, with 23 centuries in 104 Test matches and four Ashes series wins.\nMV: \"I look back over the last 10 years for English cricket and the success we've had, and at my time playing, and I wouldn't have won the big games without people like Andrew Flintoff and Pietersen.\nAS: \"He was a wonderful cricketer - his stats are quite outstanding. Many people will have enjoyed watching him bat - a box-office cricketer.\"\nMV: \"England wouldn't have won many big matches without KP. He was the man of the series in the T20 World Cup.

At least Austrians could share their pain with their neighbour Germany, who also went home with zilch.\nThe so-called big five - including the UK - were left largely disappointed, bar Italy, who came third.\nNo doubt there will be more soul-searching after another poor show for the Brits, despite Electro Velvet's valiant efforts. Deja vu. Again.\nSo that's it from me - auf Wiedersehen. See you in Sweden.\nSo Sweden's Mans Zelmerlow wins Eurovision - he's been the favourite pretty much all the way through, so not a huge surprise.\nIt's the sixth time Sweden has won the competition. Pretty impressive.\nThe inspired graphics coupled with a contemporary Aviici-style dance track clearly appealed across the continent, not least in the UK, which was one of many countries to give it 12 points.\nIt was a three-horse race between Russia, Italy and Sweden until near the end but Zelmerlow looked blown away when the presenters announced that they'd \"done the maths\" and Sweden were the winners.\nHe was given a huge hug from Conchita as she handed over her Eurovision crown.\n\"I have so much to say... I'm so extremely happy,\" Zelmerlow said as he accepted the award.\n\"We are all heroes, no matter who we love , who we are or what we believe in.\"\nIt was yet another disappointing night for the UK, who managed to get just 5 points, leaving them in 24th position.\nSo the voting is well underway and Twitter has been in overdrive since the contest started. Here's some funny ones to keep you amused while you wait for the results.\nOn Georgia\n@PIXELATEDCROWN  \"Woah can't believe they let an actual raven compete in eurovision I hope they win.\"\nOn Eurovision in general\n@Louisxmichael \"Hungary has made me hungry for better music #eurovision.\"\nOn Spain\n@richardosman  \"Nice reworking of 'Old McDonald Had A Farm' #spain #Eurovision\"\nOn Latvia\n@popbangcolour \"You know those toilet roll covers your gran has, Latvian lady has dressed like one of those... #Eurovision.\"\nOn Montenegro\n@Lozbotron \"No one in the world is more embarrassed of their dad than some kid from Montenegro right now.\"\nOn Austria\n@Cleverdever \"Piano fire just got put out. Because there's way too much hairspray in this arena for that to go on for long\"\nHungary - After all that drama, Hungary's delicate and soulful ballad comes as something of a relief. Boggie's Wars for Nothing is an acoustic number which builds up vocally as she's joined by four harmonising backing singers.\nIt's got a traditional Eurovision peace message (clue is in the title) which could go in its favour. Again, it's all about the voices but there is a very impressive constellations image projected on to the floor during the first half of the song. Thank goodness for aerial cameras.\nGeorgia - Nina Sublatti has a strong voice and she looks pretty scary as she belts out her anthem Warrior wearing a Goth-style leather jumpsuit with thigh high boots. And she's taken epaulettes to a whole new level - frankly, it looks like two ravens are poking out of her capped sleeves.\nShe says her song is about feminism, Georgian women's history, and honesty. Good on her. And it's another entry that's offering something different from the pop and ballads on offer. I just wouldn't want to be the one to tell her she hasn't won.\nAzerbaijan - Hour of the Wolf isn't a bad song but I'm afraid I was so distracted by the contemporary dancers  in harem pants swirling around Elnur Huseynov that it's hard to comment. And one of them was bare-chested, shock, horror.\nBut I do recall it had a hint of Hozier about it, at least in the verses. It's not Elnur's first time at Eurovision - in 2003, as part of duo Elnur & Samir, he came eighth. I'm not sure he'll be able to top that tonight.\nRussia - Polina Gagarina's A Million Voices is now one of the favourites to win. Some commentators in Vienna feel it sticks in the craw a little, given the song's message of peace and tolerance opposite Russia's handling of the crisis in Ukraine and its anti-gay stance. But that's not Polina's fault.\nThe song is very Eurovision and although she looks a bit nervous, her voice doesn't suffer for it. It will be some turnaround if Russia do take the Eurovision crown after last year's entry was booed by some members of the audience.\nAlbania  - Gosh, this was a hard one to sing. The notes are all over the shop.  Elhaida Dani gives it a good crack though. The staging could have been a bit more interesting.\nAgain, not a bad song but it's probably going to get lost in the penultimate spot, especially sandwiched between big hitters Russia and Italy.\nItaly - any Il Divo fans out there? You're going to love Il Volo. Some think the fact it's sung in Italian could go against it but it's a beautiful language so I can't see it myself. Simple staging for this trio - the music speaks for itself.\nIt's been a favourite for months and should feature highly even if it doesn't win. I doubt the boys will be too bothered if they don't - they've already sold one million records and collaborated with Placido Domingo and Barbra Streisand.\nMontenegro - This is only Montengro's second appearance in a Eurovision final. Knez is a huge star in his home nation and his Eurovision entry Adio has a traditional regional feel, featuring a folky instrumental opening that transports you straight to the shores of the Adriatic.\nAnd actually, that's no bad thing. A bit of old school Eurovision never hurt anyone. We were also treated to some traditional dancing with his five lovely backing singers. What's not to like?\nGermany - Sophie Ann stepped into the breach when the contestant that won the selection contest in Germany earlier this year shocked presenters by telling them he didn't want to go to Eurovision after all.\nSo instead of Andreas Kummert's acoustic ballad, we get to hear Black Smoke, a funky number from a singer who grew up in Hamburg, was born in London and studied in New York. How very international.\nThe song isn't unpleasant but it all feels just a little bit dated. And she spends the entire first verse with her back to the audience - how rude. \"We're only left with black smoke,\" Sophie Ann smoulders. I'm still worrying about that piano.\nPoland's entry, Monika Kuszynska, was very emotional about getting through to this year's final. She was in a rock pop band who were involved in a serious car accident in 2006, which left her paralysed from the waist down. \"Sometimes we can only see the dark side but many beautiful things can go with a terrible event,\" she said after making it through the second semi-final.\nIn the Name of Love is another ballad, written by Monika herself, about how she overcame the trauma she suffered. The melody is pretty run-of-the-mill but it's hard not to feel moved by the sincere performance. And she blows a little kiss to the audience at the end. Nice touch.\nLatvia - This is very different to everything else on offer and has polarised opinion here in the Austrian capital. Aminata's Love Injected is an electro ballad, which the 22-year-old penned herself. I reckon Aminata could be Latvia's answer to La Roux. She certainly sounds like Elly Jackson, particularly during the verses.\nAminata is wearing a red dress that wouldn't look out of place on Diana Ross but she does own the stage (I'm back in Cowell mode). And she should be applauded for entering something unusual.\nRomania - Yet another pared-down set, this time for Romanian artist Voltaj with his song De La Capat (All Over Again). The stage is scattered with strategically placed suitcases though. Is he hoping to make a quick getaway? But I like the way he chops and changes between Romanian and English throughout his performance.\nThe song is about supporting children whose parents have to leave their homeland to work abroad and he finishes with a message to the audience: \"Don't leave the children behind\". Er, I think he might be aiming this at me. Kids, I'll be back from Vienna on Sunday. Promise.\nSpain - now this, folks, would be just another ballad if it wasn't for the costume gimmicks! Bring it on! Edurne - David de Gea's girlfriend for the footy fans amongst you - starts off by climbing over a man lying on the stage. Good start. And it gets better. So she's wearing a red evening dress with a Kylie-style snood hood that she pushes back before launching into the strong chorus.\nMeanwhile, the long train of her dress is billowing behind her thanks to a bit of wind machine action and the man who was lying on the floor has recovered himself sufficiently to pull the train, resulting in Edurne's dress flying off to reveal a glittery gold number underneath!\nI was worried there might be a Madonna moment as he tugged on the train but they must have sensibly opted for Velcro. Well, it worked of Buck's Fizz. Not only that, there are also some ambitious dance lifts a la Strictly (Len would definitely NOT approve).\nCyprus - John Karayiannis says his influences are Ed Sheeran and John Mayer, although to be honest, you wouldn't know it by listening to his Eurovision entry, One Thing I Should Have Done. Personally, I think he sounds more like Will Young. This is probably the most traditional ballad in the contest.\nIt does have quite an old-fashioned feel so maybe that's why the first verse was broadcast in black and white. Members of the audience wave their obligatory phone torches in time to the music and John looks like he's about to cry by the end of the song. Oh dear. John says his eyesight is so bad he can't see further than the end of his nose but he has 9 spare pairs so he should be alright.\nAustralia - This is the perfect antidote to Cyprus (no offence but there are a LOT of ballads in this year's contest). This year's wildcard has split opinion in terms of whether it should have been allowed to enter but lighten up people! The Aussies love Eurovision and this is a really decent pop song from established artist, Guy Sebastian.\nWe're not quite sure why he's got the M6 backdrop behind him - it's not saying exotic Gold Coast to me - but we're loving the jaunty hat and the dancing's not bad either. Tonight Again could land top five.\nBelgium - Loic Nottet came second in the 2013 Belgium version of The Voice as part of BJ Scott and this entry, Rhythm Inside, is a bold effort and has more than a touch of Lorde's hit Royals about it. Australian artist Sia recently re-tweeted Loic's version of her hit Chandelier, which must say something.\nThere's a teetering pirouette in the middle which looks pretty risky plus one of the dancers appears to be doing a floor workout gym-style for some inexplicable reason. The track might be too cool and edgy for Eurovision's audience but it made it through the first semi-final so watch this space.\nAustria - Conchita is a hard act to follow and this year's Austrian act has been somewhat in the shadow of the 'Queen of Austria' this week in Vienna. Rock band The MakeMakes are giving it a good crack with their song We Are Yours!\nIt's pretty low key after the whirlwind that was Conchita but they certainly haven't disgraced themselves on the big stage in front of a home crowd. And they do all have facial hair to keep the beard theme going. And we have another gimmick - woo hoo! The piano is set on fire! Er, health and safety anyone? Where are the EU regulations when you need them?\nGreece - Phew. They've either put out the piano fire or they've wheeled in another for Maria Elena Kyriacou's  entry, One Last Breath. This is another typical Eurovision ballad, with a predictable 80s-style drum beat joining in for the second verse.\nShe's got a fine pair of lungs on her though and the wind machine is in full action as she builds up to the finale. Maria Elena co-wrote the song herself. Before winning a Greek talent show, she was a professor so at least that's something to fall back on if the wind doesn't blow in her favour (sorry!)\nArmenia - Genealogy, had to change their song title from Don't Deny to Face the Shadow after it was deemed too political by the powers that be with its apparent reference to the mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks 100 years ago. Not quite sure what the point was given the lyrics remain unchanged.\nBut anyway, it's a powerful rock ballad sung by a six-strong group, featuring opera-style warbling plus your more standard pop voices. There's some pretty impressive harmonies here, too.\nLithuania's upbeat This Time comes from yet another male/female duo, Monika Linkyte and Vaidas Baumila. The song can certainly hold its own and there's a three-second kiss between the pair midway through the performance which seems to go down very well with the audience. There's definitely chemistry there.\nSerbia's entry has the perfect ingredients for a Eurovision hit. Big diva voice, spooky dancers with masks who strip off to reveal new costumes, reminiscent of Bucks Fizz, and an \"I am what I am\" message from its plus-size singer, Bojana Stamenov. Beauty Never Lies starts off as a ballad before building into a classic Euro discobeat dance track that is sending audiences wild in Vienna.\nAnd hats off to the backing vocalists/dancers for presenting the chorus in sign language while leaping around the stage. This could be a surprise winner.\nNorway's entry is a real grower and duo Morland and Debrah Scarlett have to be one of the coolest acts in this year's final. Some songs don't need gimmicks and this is one of them. Their song, A Monster Like Me, is creeping up in the betting odds and it's a really hard one to call - it could be too slow for voters hearing it for the first time and it's not typical Eurovision fare. Then again, that could work in their favour.\nKjetil Morland comes from southern Norway but has spent most of his adult life in the UK, after moving there to study. This of course explains his very English accent which threw me off guard in yesterday's press conference. So worth cheering them on along with Electro Velvet if you like the UK connection. (Don't tell anyone but this is my favourite).\nSweden is favourite to win this year's contest with Mans Zelmerlow's Heroes and it's not hard to see why. The Aviici-style track is being belted out by Eurovision fans across Vienna (including on a tram last night on the way back the press centre) but its trump card is the stunning background graphics.\nThe innovative and interactive projections wouldn't look out of place at the Brits or Grammys. Whether the graphics should be as important a factor as the song itself is a debate that will no doubt rumble on should Sweden win.\nSlovenia - This was a slick opening performance from married duo Marjetka and Raay. Their act is called Maraaya, a combination of... you've got it, Marjetka and Raay. Here For You has a genuine contemporary edge with a catchy chorus that should see it do well tonight. And it can't be easy kicking off a show watched by nearly 200m people on TV.\nNot sure if the huge headphones paired with a wedding dress is a good look but anything goes at Eurovision.  Their act also features a very energetic dancer playing an imaginary violin, plus Raay making love with the camera from his piano seat. Whatever floats your boat.\nFrance - Not one act who has been placed second in the line-up at Eurovision has ever won. So it's a tough ask for France's Lisa Angell. Let's hope her lucky routine is in place - when her daughter is backstage with her, Lisa kisses her on the forehead and if she's not there, she keeps a picture of her close by. Bless.\nLisa's a fantastic and powerful singer live but I can't see this ballad doing the business, despite the men in uniform flanking her on either side. It's one of the few entries this year to be sung in a native tongue, titled N'oubliez Pas. Or Don't Forget. Sorry Lisa, we just might.\nIsrael - Golden Boy, Nadav Guedj, certainly lives up to his name here in the press centre. They absolutely love the 16-year-old bundle of energy who intends to prove he's \"the king of fun\". For his tender years, he oozes confidence and totally owns the stage (I'm channelling my inner Simon Cowell).\nAnd check out his bling winged gold trainers. His track covers all angles, starting off with a ballad-like solo which morphs into a Justin Timberlake-style dance track before it leads into a Middle Eastern-influenced chorus. Hold on to your hats.\nEstonia - Elina Born and Stig Rasta certainly have their country behind them - they picked up 79% of the vote from Estonian TV viewers in the selection contest. Goodbye to Yesterday has some pretty odd lyrics in places (\"I'm all alone, lying here naked waiting by the phone\" for starters). Songwriter Stig rarely sings himself, he usually just writes for other people. And you can tell.\nDon't get me wrong, he can hold a tune but Elina definitely has the stronger voice. However, the song is strong and the pair will be hoping for a second win for Estonia in Vienna. The piece de resistance is a clever illusion which sees Stig \"disappear\" into thin air at the end of the performance. Hurrah, the first real gimmick of the night!\nUnited Kingdom - Rolling Stones tribute act singer Alex Larke and vocalist Bianca Nicholas are really enjoying the ride here in Vienna. Their song, Still In Love With You, has been the subject of much debate on social media and Alex himself has described it as a \"Marmite\" song i.e. you either love it or hate it. But it's a fun ditty and in a Eurovision Song Contest sadly lacking in gimmicks this year, Electro Velvet's performance should stand out.\nKeep your eye on those costumes, that's all I'm saying. Not to mention Bianca's fabulous hair extensions and some pyrotechnics for good measure. Don't forget, Sandie Shaw won in Vienna in 1967 with Puppet On A String. Let's hope it's a good omen.\nThe show is being hosted by three women, Mirjam Weichselbraun, Alice Tumler and Arabella Kiesbauer but Conchita is clearly the lady of the moment as she pops up out of a podium in a sparkling pink number - and now the 'Queen of Austria' is flying across the stage!\nAll the contestants walk up to the stage surrounded by their respective flags.\nI'll be giving you my thoughts on each entry.\nThe show is just about to start, and the noise has really ramped up in the last 15 minutes or so. We'll be lucky to hear the performances at this rate!\nAnd if you're having a party, get in touch with Graham Norton and he might just give you a shout-out.\nSo hold on tight, here we go...\nOnce more unto the breach, dear friends, once more - I've arrived at the press centre and will be here for the duration.\nJust before leaving the hotel, I saw Electro Velvet dashing back out, presumably on their way to the arena.\nAnd I literally bumped into Graham Norton as I came out of the lift - or should I say, he bumped into me. He looked in a bit of a rush. For your information, the beard is looking well-groomed ahead of the final.\nOn the way to the arena, I passed dozens of fans streaming out after the final dress rehearsal, soaked to the skin.\nIt's rained pretty much solidly since I arrived - I bet the sun comes out tomorrow just as I board the plane.\nFlags are flying already inside the press room and elbows are out. A French radio station has already stuck its label on the BBC's allocated table. This could be war!\nOn a lighter note, I've just been introduced to Terry Vision - a puppet who is a reporter for unofficial Eurovision website ESC Insight.\nHmmm. Do you think he might be based on someone closer to home with a strong Eurovision association?\nEurovision fans, it's the day you've been waiting for - the grand final!\nIt's raining here in Vienna (just for a change) but that isn't dampening anyone's spirits.\nI've just spotted Alex from Electro Velvet in the hotel foyer looking relaxed ahead of the final dress rehearsal this afternoon and the place is swarming with fans - I bumped into several members of one unofficial fan club from London who did an impromptu dance routine in the hotel reception complete with LED light gloves, presumably in honour of Electro Velvet's illuminating stage show.\nNot to mention their specially made T-shirts carrying the slogan: \"Sounding Good, Sugar\", a line from Still In Love With You.\nThe bookies' odds have made interesting reading during the week, with fluctuations aplenty following each semi-final.\nAccording to Oddschecker this morning, which compiles all the big bookmakers, Sweden are still out in front, followed by Russia - who have edged past Italy, now lying in third.\nBelgium and Australia are also in the running.\nElectro Velvet are somewhere in the middle.\nBut who knows? Last year, it was predicted that the UK would claim a top five place but we ended up coming a disappointing 17th.\nThe Eurovision experts here in Vienna have also been sharing their thoughts about how it might go tonight.\nPaul Jordan, best known as Dr Eurovision, told me: \"Sweden is one to watch, they usually do well.\n\"It's not the best song but it's contemporary and his performance is really innovative.\n\"Russia could do well. Given the wider political context it will be interesting to watch the reaction for this [they were booed last year].\"\nThat's unlikely to happen this year, though.\nAccording to The Moscow Times, Eurovision organisers have \"sound-reducing\" technology at the ready to silence the audience should any booing occur this evening.\nIn Copenhagen last year, Russia's Tolmachevy Twins were repeatedly booed, although they ended up in seventh place.\nThe pair took the flak for their mother country's stance on Ukraine and Russia's record on gay rights.\nWe'll find out tonight if Russia's entry this year, Polina Gagarina, with her song about tolerance and peace, will suffer the same fate.\nJust bumped into Kathrin Zechner, director of television at ORF, Austria's state broadcaster.\nShe was responsible for choosing Conchita to represent Austria at last year's contest and is in charge of the show's production.\n\"We went for the most challenging and she has a wonderful voice. She is so laidback and wise for her age.\n\"I told her to present six songs and Phoenix just stood out.\"\n\"Tears, happiness and pride! When they said Austria was in the lead, I nearly fainted!\"\n\"The theme of the eye is about the vision of life and keeping an eye on the people around you.\n\"We've put the green room in the middle of the room, so it's really part of the show, as are the audience.\n\"The Building Bridges theme is about diversity, between old and young, women and men, different races, sexuality.\n\"I'm the only female director on my board, so that's my focus. Men will never give a place to women for free, you really have to push.\n\"We wanted three Austrians who are multi-lingual, from different ethnic groups. They're all professionals and all working mums.\"\n\"Keep an eye on your neighbour, Austria is a great place to visit and we built the longest, sparkly bridge - to Australia and back!\"\nWe're all a bit bleary-eyed in the press centre this morning after the semi-final last night but thankfully, one of the BBC producers has come armed with PG Tips to keep us going. I managed to grab UK hopefuls Electro Velvet for a quick chat ahead of the first dress rehearsal for the final.\nBianca: \"We just can't wait to get up there. The nerves are starting to come a little, but that's a good thing. It just means that you care a lot about it.\"\nAlex: \"I think we'll be quite pumped on the night, there'll be a lot of adrenaline!\"\nBianca: \"All that stuff is totally outside of our control. If you focus on where you're going to come, how you're doing in the odds, it can distract you from the performance which is the most important thing.\"\nAlex: \"We've put ourselves in our own little bubble, so we're not communicating with the outside world. We're just getting on with making sure our performance is tip top and then hopefully the rest will fall into place.\"\nBianca:  \"I hope we'll feel on top of the world and feel proud of what we've done wherever we come.\"\nAlex:  \"There might be a glass of wine!\"\nBianca: \"We're quite lucky we're on early so we can then enjoy everyone else's performances. We've made some really good friends, it's like one big family. So we'll get to see some of our friends' performances and we're rooting for them, too.\"\nAlex: \"We did a little stint on the ukulele (at last night's semi-final). When they announced the UK, the place went nuts - it's been great, it lifted me.\"\nBianca: \"It's so nice that a complete stranger wants to approach you and wish you good luck. It's really encouraging.\"\nBianca: \"Eurovision is very fan-led, the staging is getting better and better and we're using state-of-the-art technology in our performance, it's just moving with the times.\"\nMore and more fans are descending on the Austrian capital as Grand Final day looms and I caught up with Mike and Louise, a couple from Nottingham, who are first-timers at Eurovision.\nMichael: \"We wanted to come to Vienna anyway so we thought, 'let's kill two birds with one stone'. We're more festival-goers really, we're off to the Isle of Wight later this year. It took us two days to get here because Louise doesn't fly!\nMike:  \"I think it's OK, I think it was wrong to put in the old has-beens - Englebert and Bonnie - in it.\nLouise: \"Electro Velvet were just put together for this, it's just one record and we might not hear from them again.\"\nMike:  \"We went to the first semi-final. Most of the songs were big ballads or very poppy and I think Electro Velvet have been quite clever, it's slightly off-beat.\nLouise: \"I think the song's catchy.\"\nMike:  \"They played it live in the auditorium and it came across OK with the sound system beefing it up.\"\nLouise: \"Everyone was cheering. You can never tell!\"\nLouise: \"It's me really! It's always been there since you were young. In the last 8-10 years it's changed again, young people are having parties. In England we always know we're never going to win. Good bands don't want to be part of it.\"\nMichael: \"If Take That or Blur entered, they wouldn't win... It's all political.\"\nLouise: \"I love Italy but having seen Serbia, I think with the lyrics, the big ballad start-off and then the beat, it's got all the ingredients.\nMichael: The Australian one was good. That's a good pop song.\nSo we now have the order of the 26 acts in grand final. The UK is in fifth - Alex from Electro Velvet told me just now he was pleased with the slot, adding that many of the upbeat songs are in the first half. They are sandwiched between a strong track from Estonia and Armenia's moody protest ballad. France had better start worrying though - no-one who is second in the line-up has ever won Eurovision. Here's the list in full.\n1.Slovenia\n2.France\n3.Israel\n4.Estonia\n5.United Kingdom\n6.Armenia\n7.Lithuania\n8.Serbia\n9.Norway\n10.Sweden\n11.Cyprus\n12.Australia\n13.Belgium\n14.Austria\n15.Greece\n16.Montenegro\n17.Germany\n18.Poland\n19.Latvia\n20.Romania\n21.Spain\n22.Hungary\n23.Georgia\n24.Azerbaijan\n25.Russia\n26.Albania\n27.Italy\nAnd breathe... now we know the entire line-up for Saturday's grand final.\nThe biggest cheers went up in the press room for performances from Azerbijian, Montenegro, Slovenia, Israel, Norway and Sweden during the second semi-final - and that was reflected in the vote tonight, as they all went through.\nThey were joined by Lithuania, Poland - which seemed to be something of a surprise to some - Cyprus and Latvia.\nEveryone held their breath as they waited for the last act to land a place in the final -  and it went to Israel's 16-year-old Nadav Guedj.\nSadly, the other 16-year-olds in the competition - San Marino duo Michele Perniola and Anita Simoncini - will not be joining him.\nMultiple-Eurovision winner Ireland also missed the cut, as did Malta, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Iceland.\nI spoke to Eurovision expert John Kennedy O'Connor after the results were announced: \"Heartbreak of course in Ireland. It's 20 years now since their run of incredible Eurovision glory was halted and for the second year in a row, they didn't make the final.\n\"The poor Czechs were bounced out again and they are yet to ever appear on the final stage. San Marino of course disappointed and the youngest singers in the contest couldn't capitalise on their experience in the junior event last year.\"\nSo who is responsible for the outcome?\nViewers at home were able to vote in the semi-final if their country was performing in it. The UK are one of the \"Big Five\" who will go straight through to the final but Brits were allowed to vote on Thursday night.\nThe public determined half of the vote and the other half was down to the national juries of all the countries taking part or allocated to the semi-final.\nAs the results came through, the betting odds online began frantically changing before my eyes as we finally knew for definite who would be singing on Saturday night.\nRussia, Belgium and Serbia are looking good while Sweden and Italy are still the favourites. Australia, Estonia, and now Norway, could also be in the running.\nThere was a jubilant atmosphere at the press conference that followed the show - the losers and their supporters must have sneaked out the back.\nI think I was the only Brit among a sea of excitable Israelis surrounding me on all sides of the seating area, and it wasn't long before they broke into a spontaneous rendition of Guedj's Golden Boy.\nPoland's entry, Monika Kuszynska, was very emotional about getting through. She was in a rock pop band who were involved in a serious car accident in 2006, which left her paralysed from the waist down.\n\"I feel I've got something to say, a message to put in my songs. Sometimes we can only see the dark side but many beautiful things can go with a terrible event. I always look on the bright side, that's why I'm here.\"\nSweden's Mans Zelmerlow said he was feeling \"happy and relieved\" after going through  before admitting, \"I could have done some things better tonight. I was a bit rushed in the second verse, so I hope I'll be in the running to be champ!\"\nDon't worry Mans, you have three dress rehearsals before the big event to make it perfect.\nThere's a frisson in the air today in the Eurovision press centre as the 'Austrian Queen', aka Conchita, is in the house.\nHer press conference was crammed to the gills with journos and Eurovision superfan bloggers. She didn't disappoint, entering the room wearing a dress slit to the waist to the strains of her single You Are Unstoppable.\nWhat's it like hosting the green room at the semi-finals, ahead of Saturday's grand final?\n\"Three days ago I thought: 'Why would I agree on doing this? Last year, the last thing I wanted was for anyone to ask me how I felt! But I really do enjoy it, it's a new experience. I'm pushing my boundaries - I have just one minute and 48 seconds for each contestant.\"\nHow have you dealt with the fame that came with your win last year?\n\"I'm still not used to being a known person outside Austria. It's something I really appreciate.\"\nAnd you've written a book about your life already!\n\"I'm just 26, it was too early to write my memoirs - there weren't that many! But then we came up with a concept that everyone liked, a book that I myself would like - with many pictures!\"\nMidway through proceedings, the MD of Sony Records in Austria surprised Conchita with a platinum award for her self-titled album.\nConchita: \"What are you doing here? Am I fired? [Then] Thank you so much, gosh, that's unbelievable, thank you so much to my fans, that's huge.\"\nHow do you feel about Conchita lookalikes?\n\"I'm flattered people copy my look at carnivals etc - it's easy, a man just doesn't have to shave!\"\nWhy are you known now just as Conchita, not Conchita Wurst?\n\"I heard the only way you get an Oscar is to drop your surname!\"\nYou're a very positive person but some things must make you angry?\n\"Any negativity in the last year was about me and my character and I really don't care about other peoples' opinions.\nWith things in society - all I can do is reach as many people as possible through a camera and hopefully reach other people who have more influence than I do.\n\"I would love to meet President Putin. I would love to spend a week with him to understand what it's like to be President Putin, but I don't know if it's going to happen!\"\nDo you have a favourite in this year's contest?\n\"I do and I won't tell you!\"\nGuten morgen from Vienna.\nThe Australian fans are the big story at Eurovision this year, as Guy Sebastian vies to take the Eurovision crown beyond Europe's shores for the first time in the competition's history.\nI caught up with an Aussie family - mum, son and daughter - who had travelled from Queensland to join the party.\nSo what's brought you all the way from Australia?\nNick: \"We're here because Conchita won and we love Conchita.\"\nMichaela (mum):  \"I was born in Austria so for me, Conchita's win was a huge thing. That's why I had to come back and they came with me.\"\nHave you always been big Eurovision fans?\nMichaela: \"Yes. I used to make them sit and watch. I grew up with Eurovision in the '70s, so they just had to listen - there was no escape!\"\nHow did you feel when you found out that Australia were going to be part of the competition this year?\nEloise: \"It was pretty exciting as we were coming anyway.\"\nWhat do you think of Guy's song, Tonight Again?\nNick: \"I think he'll do really well, it's a good song, everyone likes it over here and he's a great performer. We voted for him when he was on Australian Idol.\"\nHave you had a good reception here in Vienna?\nEloise: \"Everyone loves Australians (we're kind of a novelty).\"\nMichaela: \"Everyone is friendly and we've come from afar. There have been mixed reactions to us being in it, but such is life.\"\nNick: \"They think it's kind of weird we've come all the way - it is a bit odd as we're not in Europe. I think a lot of people are perplexed as to why we love it so much.\"\nWhy do the Australians love Eurovision so much?\nNick: \"It's the immigrant population: Greeks, Italians, English, Austrian.\nMichaela: \"For the older generation, it's like a part of home for us. When we watch it, it brings Europe a bit closer. I think that's why a lot of the immigrants like it - and then their children either grow up liking it or hating it!\"\nAnd do you have any other Eurovision favourites this year?\nAll (in unison): \"Belgium, we love Belgium!\"\nAfter a whirlwind introduction to the craziness of the press room, we raced down to Vienna's beautiful City Hall Square - home to the Eurovision Village all this week. Crowds had gathered and the stage was set for the \"Big Five\" contestants (France, Italy, the UK, Germany, Spain) plus wildcard Australia to prove themselves ahead of Saturday's grand final.\nThe square was packed with fans from across the continent and beyond, despite the heavy rain which decided to make an appearance just as the bizarre warm-up acts - lindy hop and flamenco dancers anyone? - got going.\nGuy Sebastian was first up, receiving a raucous welcome, not least from a substantial group of Aussies who clearly felt it was worth the air fare and 24-hour flight to join the party.\n\"You guys are awesome for staying in the rain. We love Eurovision in Australia  and we are super-excited to be taking part.\"\nGuy chose to perform an acoustic rendition of Tonight Again, saying he wanted to save the full show for Saturday.\nFrench contestant Lisa Angell was up next, with one of the few Eurovision entries this year not to be sung in English, N'oubliez Pas (that's \"Don't Forget\" to me and you).\nSo does she want to win? \"If I want something, I want something,\" she said. \"If I want bread, I want bread, if I want cheese, I want cheese, so if I want to win, I want to win.\" Er, ok.\nIt was soon time for the Brits to cheer as Electro Velvet - Alex Larke and Bianca Nicholas - arrived, complete with the obligatory apology from Alex for \"bringing the weather with us\".\nWith the rain now streaming down, the lyrics \"Don't go out in the pouring rain / You might get wet, I'd be upset\" seemed just a little ironic.\nFor some reason, Germany's Ann Sophie wasn't present so we had to make do with the video that accompanies her track, Black Smoke.\nItaly and Spain rounded off the evening, with Italian trio Il Volo belting out their Il Divo-esque Grand Amore. It got the biggest ovation of the night and many here believe it's a serious contender for the Eurovision crown.\nSpain's Edurne then belted out her gutsy number Amanecer as the rain finally cleared up and the crowds began to disperse.\nSo I've made it into the frankly massive Eurovision press centre - 800 square metres with 800 separate work spaces.\nA dress rehearsal for tomorrow night's second semi-final is just about to begin. Nerves are jangling, as the elimination of PKN at last night's show proved no-one is safe.\nThe rehearsal is being beamed across the press centre on giant screens but, sadly, I'm not allowed to give you any updates - none of the rehearsals can be reported on.\nMeanwhile, Vienna itself has gone Eurovision crazy. The city's Madame Tussaud's now has a wax figure of last year's winner, Conchita Wurst, and there's even a display in the Leopold Museum titled Nul-Pointers.\nThe exhibition contains - you guessed it - a portrait of each of the 34 Eurovision participants whose performances did not earn them a single point. According to the museum, \"they represent icons of failure\".\nTalk about a back-handed compliment.\nEarlier, I spotted my first gay-themed pedestrian traffic light (see above). They were due to be removed in June but Maria Vassilakou, in charge of traffic issues in the local council, has said they will now remain.\nRight, it's time for me to hop off to the Euro Village to see the \"Big Five\" performing. I'll report back later.\nMalta's enigmatic singer Amber has been spreading the Eurovision message of peace and equality ahead of her performance at the second semi-final on Thursday.\nYesterday, she was seen sporting a \"Yes\" badge when she met Ireland's Molly Sterling in Vienna, to show her support for the marriage equality referendum - which takes place on Friday in Ireland. It's the world's first referendum on same sex marriage and is, of course, being closely followed by the many gay fans of Eurovision.\nEarlier today, Amber was spotted at Vienna's Learning Cafe, a free service for kids and teenagers from refugee families.\nAmber plans to become a primary school teacher after Eurovision, so at least she has something to fall back on should her song, Warrior, not make it through to the grand final.\nPress accreditation sorted, with much excitement surrounding the goody bags handed out to journalists - salami, sausages, you name it. Shame I'm vegetarian. Still, the chocolate and random shoe polish makes up for it.\nI've not even left the airport lounge yet and the first big shock of Eurovision 2015 has happened without me. PKN, Finland's hotly tipped and much-hyped punk outfit, failed to make it through the first semi-final last night.\nShame - their song made a change from the plethora of power ballads on offer this year (even if it wasn't that easy on the ear).\nThe Netherlands may be four-times Eurovision winners, having last won in 1975, but any hopes of adding to that tally were also dashed on Tuesday night when they fell at the first hurdle.\nFour other contenders will also be going home disappointed - Moldova, FYR Macedonia, Belarus and Denmark.\nBut it's not all bad news - Moldova's early exit means Eduard Romanyuta can go back to his PhD thesis on Ukranian tax policy. I kid you not.\nHere are the 10 countries that did make the grade:\nSee you in Vienna!\nAnd we're off\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 16 countries will go head-to-head at the first Eurovision semi-final tonight live from Vienna, with 10 lucky acts going through to Saturday's grand final.\nAmong those could be Finland's punk rock outfit PKN, Russia's Polina Gagarina - with a song about unity, fairness and equality - and Estonia's ones to watch, duo Elina and Stig.\nThis year's competition has a lot to live up to after Conchita Wurst stormed to glory in 2014 in Copenhagen.  The self-styled \"bearded lady\" will Rise Like a Phoenix once more to host this year's green room in both the semis and the final itself.\nAnd never fear, the UK's entry, Electro Velvet, has a guaranteed slot on the stage this Saturday. As one of the \"Big Five\" which contribute the most money to the European Broadcasting Union - along with Italy, Spain, France and Germany - the UK goes through automatically. Phew.\nAs last year's winner, Austria also gets a bye into the final as does this year's surprise package, Australia, which has been invited to take part to celebrate the song contest's 60th anniversary.\nYou can watch both semi-finals (the second takes place on Thursday) on BBC Three at 20:00 BST tonight and on Thursday.", "output": ["This year's Eurovision Song Contest has taken place in Vienna."]}, {"id": "task1290-d17c90f72b424cb2bdc2d2f81e758552", "input": "Fees were due to start last Monday, but a delay to install the new system and train staff meant charging had to be postponed.\nThe council said reintroducing charges was necessary to fund a new ferry and support the service.\nBut it has angered residents who formed a Facebook group to oppose the charges.\nThe 38-year-old chain ferry, which links Cowes and East Cowes, is being replaced by Isle of Wight Council next summer.\nThe chain ferry, which takes about two to three minutes to cross the river and means users avoid a 20-mile round trip, has provided free river crossings for pedestrians and cyclists since 1992.\nAn estimated one million foot passengers and cyclists use it each year.\nTolls for drivers currently range from \u00c2\u00a32.20 for cars to \u00c2\u00a37.60 for lorries.

But that can wait. There is nothing more important than ditching Jeremy Corbyn.\"\nAn ex-minister close to the former leader Gordon Brown was, in private, even more robust: \"Labour is facing an existential threat.\n\"If Jeremy Corbyn leads us in to the 2020 election, it's all over for the party. We are screwed.\"\nWhile some in the parliamentary party rail against their leader, others are more resigned to his continuation in office - and the consequences. A former minister close to another former leader - Tony Blair - declared: \"I find a new reason to despair every day.\"\nAnd some of their colleagues who attended a meeting of Labour's Parliamentary party on Monday night were incensed by reports of how the proceedings were briefed by Mr Corbyn's spokesman.\nHe had characterised the meeting as marking the night the Labour mainstream sided with Jeremy Corbyn, who had face down his internal opponents.\nThe leader had called for unity and told his MPs to stop \"sniping\" - and they in turn had tempered their criticism. There had been a \"sea change in attitudes\" said the spokesman.\nSome of those present did not recognise this account and the \"sea change\" appears, in fact, to be a hardening of the attitudes of those who want Jeremy Corbyn ousted.\nThere has been a lot of shadow boxing between a Parliamentary Labour Party which overwhelmingly opposed Mr Corbyn's election as leader - and members and supporters who delivered it.\nBut now, at the very least, a minority of MPs seem more determined than ever to mount a challenge sooner rather than later.\nThe May elections in Scotland, Wales, London and English local authorities are set to be spun by Mr Corbyn's allies and critics alike.\nAt Monday's meeting the party leader refused to be drawn on how many council seats he expects to win (or lose).\nThat is meant to make it trickier for opponents to declare he has failed.\nBut party insiders believe 200 or more seats in England are vulnerable.\nSo the Corbynistas are responding in two ways.\nThe successor to the Corbyn leadership campaign - Momentum - will try to put well motivated activists into areas which are vulnerable.\nWith poor turnouts in many council contests, it's possible a good \"ground war\" could reap benefits and stem losses - or even lead to some unexpected gains. Momentum bussed supporters into the Oldham West by-election late last year.\nThe assumption was that Labour might just scrape home on a low turnout - in fact a relatively respectable 40% went to the polls, and Labour's vote share increased.\nBut even if council results turn out to be disappointing, the leadership are confident Sadiq Khan will defeat Zac Goldsmith in the London mayoral contest and that Labour won't slip to third place in Scotland.\nAnd this will be presented as proof that Jeremy Corbyn's leadership is far from toxic and he needs more time to mobilise further support for the party.\nIn this narrative, setbacks elsewhere will have been due to the Parliamentary \"snipers\" shooting their own leader in the foot.\nOn the other side, senior MPs are circulating a paper pointing out how well Labour should be doing at this stage in the electoral cycle.\nIt concludes that opposition parties have always gained seats over the past 40 years except in 1982 - when Labour was in opposition but suffered the SDP split -  and in 1985 when the Militant Tendency and the miners' strike were in the headlines.\nSo some former ministers are likely to set targets of their own for Jeremy Corbyn - anything less than 300 gains will be denounced as unsatisfactory.\nSo let's assume - and this is not a prediction, just a scenario - that some Labour MPs will say Jeremy Corbyn has failed to clear the hurdles they have constructed for him. The rules are clear that it would take 20% of the combined total of Labour MPs and MEPs - 51 politicians - to trigger a leadership challenge.\nBut It's less clear if Jeremy Corbyn's name would then automatically be on the ballot.\nThe rule book here is open to interpretation.\nOne Corbyn opponent points out that when Tony Benn challenged the incumbent Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, the latter was required to gather nominations, too - and he says this would set a precedent.\nAnd Labour officials stress the importance of \"custom and practice\" when determining these issues.\nThat would mean Mr Corbyn would then have to gather 35 nominations from his fellow MPs to stand, if challenged.\nHe only gained that number last year because some of his Parliamentary colleagues wanted to \"broaden the debate\" and didn't expect him to win.\nSo it's possible he could be kept off the ballot. And that would be the best opportunity opponents would have to defeat him.\nA YouGov poll of party members in February suggested if Jeremy Corbyn were on the ballot paper, he would win a leadership contest comfortably, with \"soft-left\" shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn second, and ex-paratrooper Dan Jarvis - who gave a keynote speech on Thursday in which he denounced inequality and distanced himself, to a degree, from New Labour - narrowly behind in third place.\nHowever, members were also shown a ballot paper without Jeremy Corbyn's name on it - and Hilary Benn, Tom Watson, Angela Eagle and Dan Jarvis were pretty much bunched together in that order.\nSo, unsurprisingly, Mr Corbyn's supporters in the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy are trying to make the rules less ambiguous - by getting the party's sovereign body, the annual conference, to agree that if challenged, the leader's name would automatically be on any ballot - and in future only 5%, not 15%, of MPs would need to nominate a candidate if Mr Corbyn were to stand down.\nThis would mean about a dozen MPs would have to give their backing. As Jeremy Corbyn had 14 genuine supporters in the Parliamentary party at last year's leadership contest, this lower threshold would mean a left-wing successor could not be blocked by their sceptical Parliamentary colleagues.\nThey would then put themselves before a membership whose centre of gravity is to the left of most Labour MPs for approval.\nSo that is why some of those who were close to either Blair or Brown believe it is worth trying to challenge the current leader before his position becomes more entrenched.\nBut despite all the talk about rules, privately the plotters believe that even if Mr Corbyn were required to seek nominations from fellow MPs to re-stand, due to a mixture of patronage and the fear of being deselected by new left-wing party members, it's perfectly possible that 35 MPs would support him this time in any case.\nIf so, any challenger would have their work cut out, according to that You Gov membership survey.\nTwo thirds of respondents said they wanted Jeremy Corbyn to lead Labour into the next general election. But crucially, asked if he should do so even if the May elections go badly for Labour, 53% of members would still want him to remain as leader until at least 2020.\nSo now there isn't just a division between most Labour MPs and their leader.\nAmongst the non-Corbynistas, there are those that say it would be pointless to launch a leadership contest he is likely to win - and those who say they have to be seen to be making the argument that he is leading the party to disaster.\nThe mood between the two camps isn't quite as convivial as it once was.\nA member of the latter group privately denounced the former as \"collaborators\".  Members of this albeit fluid grouping - \"there isn't a Committee to Get Rid of Jeremy Corbyn\", said one MP - are coming to the conclusion that a leadership challenge is worth a roll of the dice.\nBut would Mr Corbyn simply fall on his sword if May's elections bring poor results?\nSome MPs say he isn't enjoying the job but a well-connected former Labour strategist is convinced he wouldn't step aside.\nHe says sections of the press - and Parliament - are \"using the wrong metric to look at his success and failure\".\nHe believes \"those around him want to take on and change the party before thinking about trying to change the country - so winning elections isn't their priority\".\nSo if he won't go of his own volition, July seems to be the likely time for a challenge.\nAs Dan Jarvis pointed out in his remarks to Westminster journalists on Thursday, Labour members and supporters would not forgive MPs who are not entirely focussed on May's elections and June's referendum.\nBut whenever a contest comes, Mr Corbyn's backers are confident he would win because the mood amongst the membership is against a return to \"top down\" politics and Parliamentary coups.\nThey don't buy the idea that, whatever the rules, it would be possible to exclude a leader who gained an overwhelming mandate just six months ago.\nA leading light in Momentum put it like this: \"They can challenge Jeremy if they want.

However, this absence was accepted by trading standards on the basis that the statements on pack are supported by a 'high in protein' claim.\"\nMr Neville defended the label's specific reference to whey protein on the basis that \"whey protein contains all nine essential amino acids\".\nA Cambridgeshire County Council spokesman confirmed a trading standards officer had advised the company on the \"compliance of a minor labelling issue\".\nFor more on this story, watch BBC Inside Out at 19:30 BST on Monday.", "output": ["The label on a drink containing whey protein is to be changed after unsubstantiated claims were made."]}, {"id": "task1290-ce07797e93dd412c89465fa1280dbde4", "input": "David Cameron said the actions of some fundraisers were damaging the reputation of the charity sector.\nThe changes will be introduced in amendments to the Charities Bill.\nFundraising methods have come under scrutiny since the death of poppy seller Olive Cooke, 92, in May.\nAn inquest found Mrs Cooke, from Bristol, had received 267 charity letters in one month, leading to suggestions that the hounding for money pushed her to take her own life. Her family insist the charities were not to blame.\nThe prime minister said: \"Our charities undertake vital work, bringing communities together and providing support to some of the most vulnerable members of our society.\n\"But the conduct of some fundraisers used by them is frankly unacceptable and damages the reputation of the sector as a whole, which is why we're introducing a new law to make sure charities raise funds in the right sort of way.\"\nThe conduct of charity fundraisers is under scrutiny like never before following the death of Britain's oldest poppy seller - 92-year-old Olive Cooke.\nThought to have taken her own life, she had been exhausted by requests for money from charities, according to a friend, and had set up 27 direct debits to make donations - although her granddaughter told an inquest that letters seeking money were not a factor in her death.\nThe issue, and an investigation into fundraisers' call centres by the Mail on Sunday, has attracted the attention of ministers.\nNow a new law will oblige charities and organisations that raise money on their behalf to state in their contracts how vulnerable people are to be protected and there will be a review to consider whether further action is needed. Fundraising bodies have already pledged to strengthen protections.\nUnder the new rules, charities with incomes of more than \u00c2\u00a31m will set out in their trustees' annual report their fundraising approach.\nThis will include the use of professional fundraising agencies, as well as steps to prevent inappropriate fundraising from vulnerable people, such as the elderly and people with Alzheimer's.\nThe legislation would also require all professional fundraisers to set out in their agreements with charities what steps they are taking to protect vulnerable people from high-pressure tactics.\nMinister for Civil Society Rob Wilson said the new laws would have \"some impact on charities\" but they should understand that the \"loss of revenue will come if these scandals continue to go on\".\nHe warned that a failure to respond could result in full regulation of the charity sector, which \"would incur big costs for charities\".\nHe added that the government has also set up a review panel to look at measures to stop fundraisers finding \"ways around the system\". The panel will report by September.\nKate Schofield from Huddersfield told BBC Radio Four's Today programme she received about 30 calls after donating to a well-known charity by text message.\n\"I answered a TV charity appeal for Syrian refugees and donated via text. It was not long after that I started receiving quite a lot of cold calls and this went on and on.\n\"I actually ended up getting about 30 or 40 phone calls from them. They were not even starting to take \"no\" for an answer so it did start feeling like harassment.\n\"After about a couple of weeks, I was on holiday. I was getting about 10 phone calls a day.\n\"I was ignoring them because it was going to cost me a lot of money to answer them. But I did feel like every time I looked at my phone there was a missed call from the same number.\"\nSir Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), is to conduct the review to decide whether more powers are required.\n\"For every challenge we face, there is a charity that will help - be that facing cancer or saving our precious green spaces,\" he said.\n\"They are able to do this because of the trust, confidence and overwhelming generosity of the British people.\n\"We simply cannot allow aggressive fundraising tactics to damage this trust. Charities must maintain the highest standards, including taking a firm grip on how the agencies they employ are interacting with the public,\" Sir Stuart added.\nLeading UK charities Oxfam, the Salvation Army and Save the Children have welcomed the prime minister's proposals.\nTanya Steele of Save the Children said their supporters were their lifeblood and the sector had to improve to strengthen faith and trust.\nOxfam chief executive Mark Goldring said the British public were \"amazingly generous\" and he hoped a balance could be found so people could give without receiving unwanted calls.\nLast month, Oxfam suspended operations with a call centre after claims in the Mail on Sunday that Listen Ltd staff used high-pressure fundraising techniques.\nThe company said it trained employees in accordance with regulators' requirements and would investigate.", "output": ["Charities are to be forced to draw up written agreements showing how vulnerable people will be protected from aggressive fundraising tactics, the prime minister has said."]}, {"id": "task1290-10d7b6b0b05a4366a778cf1831b798f1", "input": "Non-EU citizens settling in the UK for longer than six months are also being required to pay a \"health surcharge\" as part of their visa applications.\nThe new rules from the Department of Health came into force on 6 April.\nPrimary care and A&E care continues to remain free.\nPermanent residents of 32 European countries qualify for NHS treatment, which is then billed to their country of residence, but this new ruling applies to foreign migrants or visitors based in other countries, mainly those outside the EU.\nThese patients can be treated in an NHS hospital but are expected to repay the cost of most procedures afterwards.\nBut up to now, the DoH has only sought to reclaim the actual costs, without adding any extra charges.\nThe DoH hopes the changes will help it recoup up to \u00a3500m a year by 2017-18.\nThe new guidelines do not require patients on trolleys in hospitals to produce passports before getting access to urgent care.  Nor do they apply to accident and emergency or a visit to a GP.\nWhat is covered is ongoing treatment on the NHS after an initial diagnosis or referral - for example an outpatient appointment.\nThe Department of Health is incentivising hospitals to be more vigilant in checking patient credentials by allowing them to charge more for treatment of people \"not ordinarily resident\" in the UK.\nThe department can recoup those costs from the patient's member state if they are from the European Economic Area.\nIn the paperwork filled in by the patient before the appointment they will be asked for proof they are \"ordinarily resident\".\nThis could be a utility bill, national insurance number or passport details.  Some hospitals were doing this already but many were not.\nThe guidelines are designed to increase the chances that the treatment costs for a non-UK resident can be recovered.  Critics may ask why it has taken so long for the initiative to be launched.\nThe charges are based on the standard tariff for a range of procedures, ranging from about \u00a31,860 for cataract surgery to about \u00a38,570 for a hip replacement.\nSimilar charges can be imposed by the NHS in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales for hospital care received by non-EU residents.\nPatients using hospital services have been required to show their passports and other immigration documents if their UK residence status was in doubt.\nThe \"health surcharge\" on visa applications for non-EU citizens comprises an annual fee of \u00a3200-a-year, which is reduced to \u00a3150 for students.\nCertain individuals, such as Australian and New Zealand nationals, are exempt from the surcharge.\nAnd non-EU citizens who are lawfully entitled to reside in the UK and usually live in the country will be entitled to free NHS care as they are now.\nAndrew Bridgen, the Tory MP for North West Leicestershire in the last Parliament, told the Daily Mail: \"This is not the International Health Service, it's the National Health Service.\n\"Non-UK nationals seeking medical attention should pay for their treatment.\n\"The NHS is funded by UK taxpayers for UK citizens and if any of us went to any of these countries we'd certainly be paying if we needed to be treated.\"\nDr Mark Porter of the British Medical Association questioned the feasibility, saying a doctor's duty was to \"treat the patient that's in front on them, not to act as border guard\".", "output": ["Visitors from outside the EU who receive treatment in NHS hospitals in England are now being charged 150% of the cost under changes brought in to discourage \"health tourism\"."]}, {"id": "task1290-3a684b4b9153489b8f9967e908af29aa", "input": "The 30m Wellingtonia was planted in the grounds of Wrest Park near Silsoe, Beds, in 1856 by Thomas de Grey.\nIt was brought into the mansion for the family's Christmas celebrations and re-planted once the festivities were over.\nThis year a 3ft star will be put at the top and visitors will decorate the lower branches with ribbons.\nFrom the mid-19th Century, families would bring trees in from their garden during the festive period and adorn them with candles, sweets and homemade decorations.\nEnglish Heritage said reference to its use as a Christmas tree was recently found in an edition of Gardener's Chronicle, from June 1900.\nUntil then it had not realised the significance of the tree.\nThe article said the tree was planted in 1856 and \"must therefore have been one of the first introduced into this country\".\n\"Mr Ford, the late gardener at Wrest Park... has carried the plant many times from the conservatory to the mansion, and vice versa,\" it read.\nAfter growing too large to be brought indoors, it has stood in the grounds for decades.\nJohn Watkins, from English Heritage, said it was a \"rare, documented example of a tree that was decorated and replanted annually\".\n\"Christmas trees were the height of festive fashion by the 1850s after being adopted by the Royal family as part of their celebrations,\" he said.\n\"[This tree] was planted shortly after the trend for Christmas trees began and we believe it is one of the earliest examples.\n\"If anyone knows of an earlier one, we'd like to hear about it.\"\nWrest Park is a country estate and gardens which is now owned by English Heritage.", "output": ["What is believed to be Britain's oldest Christmas tree is to be decorated for the first time in a century, English Heritage has said."]}, {"id": "task1290-7fce325ae21f434ba351fe06bcc66b8f", "input": "Sign up for our BBC Sport news notifications via the app and you will get a message to let you know of a breaking news story, major live sport or to share a great piece of content.\nThe alerts are available in the iOS and Android versions of the free, award-winning BBC Sport app - add them by heading to the menu, selecting 'My Alerts' then 'Add Alerts' followed by 'Sport News'.\nThe service will supplement the current alerts offering for data around football, rugby union, cricket and rugby league matches as well as Formula 1 grands prix.\nWhat are the alerts?\nThe notifications are small notifications which appear on the homescreen of your device.

January and 8 February 2016, there were 12 emergency callouts for self-harm or suicide attempts, 50% of the total.\nIn the previous full calendar year, there were 134 such callouts to the university, with suicide attempts or self-harm accounting for 32%.\nIn 2014, there were 158 ambulance call-outs, with 14% because of self-harm or suicide attempts.\nThis is Mental Health Awareness Week, and there has been much concern about a perceived increase in mental health problems among students.\nThere have been warnings of an increase in demand for counselling and claims that universities are not taking their pastoral responsibilities seriously enough.\nBut this is a sensitive topic, and it is unusual to get such evidence as this ambulance data.\nThe report, gathered for York's vice-chancellor and shared with students, says that both the \"prevalence and severity\" of student mental health problems is getting worse.\nThe report refers to figures for the University of York, but it also includes evidence from more than 50 universities.\nThis was gathered by the association representing university student services (AMOSSHE) and found a \"noticeable increase in complex mental health crises\" in 2015 compared with 2014.\nAnd in almost 90% of universities, staff reported working on such incidents with either the police or a coroner during 2015.\nThe report from York says its experience reflects this national trend, with more demand for counselling and health services.\nIt says the fact local NHS mental health services are also overstretched makes the problem even more difficult.\nAnd it warns of a \"paucity of high-quality evidence on the mental health of students in the UK\", adding: \"This is particularly surprising given the size of the student population.\"\nThe report says students can suffer from a misguided sense of \"perfectionism\", feeling under pressure to succeed at everything and responding with feelings of \"low self-esteem, depression, anxiety and hopelessness\" when things go wrong.\nSocial media is another significant cause of problems, with students having to respond to an ever-present \"virtual environment\", which

UK - but it does not suggest an increase.\nAnd across the whole age population, those under the age of 30 have the lowest suicide rates.\nBut these figures do not say anything about incidents that might have been attempts at suicide.\nAnd there seem to be repeated warnings of an increase in problems.\nNUS Scotland is reporting a 47% increase in demand for counselling services between 2011-12

too often it remains concealed and unsupported.\n\"Mental illness remains greatly stigmatised,\" she says.\n\"Opening up about mental difficulties is one of the hardest things a young person can do.\n\"Struggling mentally is considered a sign of personal weakness as opposed to the legitimate health concern it really is.\n\"As such, young people are more likely to continue blaming themselves for their own problems rather than opening up and seeking help for it.\n\"This just produces a generation suffering in silence.\"\nSir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of Buckingham University, wants

It argues that the fees it charges are justified, and says there's never been a better time to take out a policy.\nSo what's the problem with equity release - and what should home-owners consider before signing up to it?\nIf you are approaching retirement - or just need some cash - you can raise money against the value of your house.\nTraditionally, equity released worked like this: a finance company purchases a proportion of your house. In exchange for cash they actually own a stake in the property, but they only get their money back (plus any profit from rising house values) when you die or move out and the property is sold. This is known as a home reversion plan.\nThese days 99% of equity release products are based on a different model: a lifetime mortgage. The homeowner retains full ownership of the property but borrows money using the house as security, just like a normal mortgage. But the mortgage term is only up when you die, meaning your estate pays back the money not you. In the meantime interest accumulates on the loan, just like with a traditional mortgage.\nIt all sounds like a win-win, both for the customer and the provider.\nBut if that is the true, why did only 21,000 UK homeowners take out equity release plans last year?\nGiven that 3.4m homeowners in England alone are between the ages of 65 and 74, that means that less than 0.5% of likely customers are currently signing up.\nHere's the first problem: When you take out a lifetime mortgage, the interest rate you pay is higher than an ordinary residential mortgage.\nThe cheapest currently available is 5.4%, which is fixed for life.\nBut, also unlike a residential equivalent, lifetime mortgages involve compound interest.\nSo, assume your house is worth \u00a3300,000, and you take out \u00a3100,000 in an equity release plan, at the age of 60.\nAfter year one, the amount you owe will be \u00a3105,400.\nThat sum will then be used as the baseline to calculate the following year's interest, and so on.\nAfter 20 years -should you reach 80 - you will owe \u00a3286,293. True, the house may have gone up in value, but if not, you will have just \u00a313,707 left to pass on.\nLive just one year more, and you will have nothing left at all.\nHow compound interest eats your money\n\"People don't understand the way it builds up,\" says Merryn Somerset Webb, the editor in chief of Money Week.\n\"They find it very difficult to grasp the the concept of compound interest. It just needs to be clearer,\" she says.\nThe industry argues that lifetime mortgages are expensive, because providers are, in effect, making a triple bet: On house prices, interest rates, and how long you will live.\n\"We can't do anything about compound interest,\" says Nigel Waterson, chairman of the Equity Release Council.\n\"As Einstein said, it's the most powerful force on the planet.\" It's simply the cost of providing consumer protection, he says, such as guaranteeing that home-owners will not be responsible for any negative equity.\nThose most likely to think of equity release as a dirty word are, of course, the children likely to be disinherited.\nBut if you have no one to pass your house on to, equity release could suit you perfectly.\nCyril and Jenny Barrett, from Oxfordshire, have no children, and didn't want the taxman to benefit from their death.\nSo in May this year they took out a lifetime mortgage on their \u00a3500,000 bungalow.\nThey are both in their late 60s. They decided to withdraw \u00a3158,000, to spend on a new kitchen, and a camper van.\n\"We have nobody to leave our house to. It's quite a problem for us actually,\" says Cyril.\nGiven their mortgage rate of 5.8%, they will owe their provider \u00a3501,766 in 20 years' time, more than the house is currently worth.\nBut any debt will be written off.\n\"It does seem too good to be true,\" says Jenny. \"I'm waiting for the day they come and tell us something bad.\"\nThe companies who provide lifetime mortgages argue that the benefit homeowners are likely to get from rising prices will more than compensate for hefty charges.\n\"The rising value of their home can help offset the interest owed through equity release, which should ease fears that some have of eroding their housing equity,\" says Simon Chalk, of provider Age Partnership.\nHe advises those who want to pass money on to their children to take out no more than 20% of the equity.\nTake someone whose house is worth \u00a3250,000, and who takes 20% in cash. Twelve years later, the amount they owe the lender will have doubled.\nBut assuming house prices rise at an annual rate of at least 2%, they will still own more than \u00a3200,000 of equity. This they can pass on, subject to Inheritance Tax.\nIndeed part of the industry's argument - to be published in full next week - is that house prices are subject to the same compounding principle that applies to the charges - but this time to the benefit of home-owners.\nDoes all that mean equity release remains a dirty word?\n\"There's a gulf between the industry and the client that hasn't yet been bridged,\" says Merryn Somerset Webb.\nBut Nigel Waterson remains defensive.\n\"These days equity release is a safe and well-regulated product,\" he maintains.\nIn the months ahead the FCA will be examining how this market might be made to work more effectively.\nBut right now it's hard to imagine what new product might emerge, or whether this industry can silence its critics, permanently.", "output": ["Whether you're considering a cruise, a new kitchen, or just giving money to the children, the thought of liberating that cash from the value of your house is enticing."]}, {"id": "task1290-04852dffe5594aac86b77846fe8b0ad7", "input": "Energy firm Cuadrilla is appealing against Lancashire County Council's refusal to let it extract shale gas at Little Plumpton and Roseacre Wood.\nPlanning inspector Wendy McKay has sent her report to Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Greg Clark to scrutinise.\nThe decision is expected by 6 October.\nLancashire County Council rejected both planning applications for the Fylde sites last year on the grounds of noise and traffic impact.\nCuadrilla disputed those reasons at an inquiry chaired by Ms McKay in Blackpool earlier this year and said night-time noise would be short and affect only a handful of homes.\nThe secretary of state said he will make the final decision, as opposed to the planning inspector, because the proposals were \"of more than local significance\".\nAnti-fracking campaigners claim the process is harmful to the environment.", "output": ["Recommendations on whether fracking should be allowed in Lancashire have been submitted to the government to make a final decision on."]}, {"id": "task1290-0f790bfcc4fc4bb7b5385ea53acf664c", "input": "Gordon Sutherland said he was standing 10m away from Joy Robson, who died when a car lost control at the Snowman Rally in Inverness in February 2013.\nHe said he \"didn't feel completely safe\" and was about to change position when the crash happened.\nMr Sutherland, 53, said marshals had earlier told other spectators they should move.\nHe said he thought the officials were proactive and were \"doing their job correctly\".\nMr Sutherland, from Thurso, also told of helping to lift the crashed car to rescue a a boy, who was trapped beneath the vehicle.\nAlso giving evidence, a doctor, James MacHugh, said he reached the scene by car in 14 minutes but was slightly impeded by spectators along the route.\nWhen he arrived Mrs Robson had been moved from beneath the crashed car and was already receiving CPR.\nAnnie Butterwork, who has attended rallies since childhood, told the inquiry how she would always stand back above road level and expressed surprise at the number of people next to the track that day.\nThe 23-year-old told how moments before the crash, a marshal suspended action when a group of spectators refused to come off the road -

Yet the uncoordinated demands and needs from both sectors have resulted in fragmented collection of data.\nAfrica's middle class is rapidly rising, fuelling the second fastest growing economic bloc in the world.\nAccording to the World Bank's most recent Africa Pulse report, consumer spending accounted for more than 60% of sub-Saharan Africa's economic growth last year.\nCompanies are scrambling to get in on this growth, but one big barrier remains - how to gather reliable market information, insights and opinions from across the continent.\nFor many research firms, traditional data collection has involved sending a fleet of researchers out with pen and paper to all corners of a country.\nBut this is still the old-fashioned \"Land Rover\" methodology, says Nathan Eagle, founder and chief executive of Jana, a US-based company that powers one of the world's largest reward-for-survey platforms in emerging markets, mCent.\n\"You've got to get into an old Land Rover and head out into the field,\" he says, which is both expensive and time consuming. \"[But] with the advent of mobile phones, that is shifting.\"\nJana's platform integrates directly into the billing systems of 237 mobile operators, enabling 3.48 billion people in emerging markets to be rewarded with airtime for taking part in surveys.\nUsers sign up for Jana through a mobile-friendly website or Facebook app, enter their information, and pick what surveys they qualify for. After completing the survey, airtime - ranging from 50 US cents to $5 (30p to \u00a33) - is automatically credited to their phone.\nThe idea, says Mr Eagle, is to offer financial compensation for users that matches the valuable data they are offering to market research companies - data that would be much more expensive to obtain in other ways.\n\"We have millions of people across sub-Saharan Africa, and we're just scratching the surface here,\" he says. \"We have far more supply than demand for market research.\"\nEarlier this year, Jana helped CNN International to find out what Africans thought about the possibility of an African Pope. They surveyed 20,000 people across 11 countries over four days. (In case you're wondering, 51% felt an African Pope would be more conservative than previous Popes).\n\"It was an experiment for us,\" explains Peter Bale, vice president and general manager of CNN International Digital. \"We're experiencing high rates of growth in CNN consumption in Africa, particularly through mobile devices. So we needed to look at how we tap into that.\n\"It's a proper means of exchange,\" he adds. \"Fifty cents of airtime for six questions, and we got a tremendous flow of information.\"\nAlthough Jana rewards users through mobile airtime, users need an internet connection to fill out the surveys. The vast majority of mobile phones in Africa are feature phones, which can access the internet, but are generally sluggish in browsing and have high data costs.\nIn most cases in Africa, Mr Eagle says, users pay to go to local internet cafes, which could also cost them part of their reward.\nYet another company is addressing this problem with a different approach.\nBiNu, an Australian firm launched in 2011, is a platform that gives basic mobile feature phones essentially smartphone-like capabilities by offloading all the processing to a cloud-based server, which offers an app store.\n\"It's like your smartphone in the cloud,\" says Gour Lentell, BiNu's co-founder. This makes it cheaper and faster to browse on feature phones.\nThrough BiNu's \"Research and Rewards\" platform, customers are prompted to opt in to receive surveys and questionnaires, for which they are rewarded with BiNu \"credits\", convertible to music, books or airtime.\nWhile this type of research could be, and is being, done via text message - through companies like GeoPoll - texts have their limitations.\n\"The predominant way you'd reach consumers in emerging markets is SMS, because it works on every phone,\" explains Mr Lentell. \"But it's cumbersome and slow, and the types of questions you can post, length of text and methods of collection responses is limited.\"\nDigital may be a fast and efficient way to collect and analyse big data on the continent, but is the data deep enough to replace the old Land Rover methodology?\nIt depends, says Jasper Grosskurth of Research Solutions Africa.\n\"The problem with [digital] panels and response rates is that often all you know about the respondents is gender, age, and location or country,\" he says. \"So if I want to run a well-balanced, representative survey, that's tough. It's not as randomised.\"\nAlthough digital is cheaper, and perhaps better for basic opinion polls - like thoughts on an African Pope - if you want to thoroughly evaluate a development project, for example, \"it won't work\".\nNevertheless, small and medium-sized businesses are keen to take advantage of the benefits that digital can offer.\n\"The average consumer in Kenya makes seven to eight payments a day, even the poorest ones,\" explains Dylan Higgins, chief executive of Kopo Kopo, a Kenya-based start-up. \"Those transactions are happening, but they've largely been anonymous to date.\"\nWhile companies like BiNu and Jana use mobile phones to help big brands find new information from potential or existing consumers, Kopo Kopo aims to find what data already exists, and make it available to local businesses.\nM-Pesa, the mobile money service that launched in Kenya in 2007, now has more than 17 million users.\nKopo Kopo captures all of a firm's untracked M-Pesa transactions, and digitises them into a dashboard for business owners to better understand and engage with their customers.\nOnce businesses are aware of their customers' profiles and spending habits, they can engage with them through offers, rewards, surveys and more.\n\"A lot of global brands are entering the African market, but there are also a number of brands developing in this market that could become regional or global,\" says Mr Higgins.\n\"It's a democratising tool that levels the playing field. As much as I would love to work with the larger brands, why should they be the only ones who can afford to understand and engage their customers?\"", "output": ["\"One thing about data in Africa is that there's a huge lack of it,\" says Jasper Grosskurth, managing director of Research Solutions Africa, a pan-African research firm based in Nairobi, Kenya."]}, {"id": "task1290-faff1a6d1f9b4e77aeb226a16640ee08", "input": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nBenn, 53, and Collins, 52, have told BBC Sport they have agreed to meet again, 21 years after their last fight.\n\"If it was a charity match, the British Boxing Board of Control might turn a blind eye,\" said Bunce. \"But neither would make enough money.\"\nBenn told 5 live there were \"other avenues\" for getting a licence.\nBritish fighters David Haye and Dereck Chisora obtained clearance from Luxembourg's boxing federation prior to their fight at Upton Park in July 2012.\n\"They will not fight in this country under BBBofC rules,\" said Bunce. \"You can forget that.\n\"That means it will take place under a Maltese licence or some other foreign body.\"\nLondoner Benn feels he could convince the BBBofC that he is fit enough to compete.\nBut Dublin-born Collins, who beat Benn twice in 1996, and leading promoter Eddie Hearn do not think the organisation will sanction the fight.\nBBBofC general secretary Robert Smith said on Thursday that neither Benn nor Collins had applied for a licence to fight again.\nHe said the only age limit imposed on those applying is they must be over 18, but added: \"The older you get, the more unlikely it is.\"\nSmith said he would be \"surprised\" if anyone wanted to promote the fight.\nThe BBBofC seeks to \"minimise risk\" and ensure boxers are \"fully prepared\" when giving the go-ahead for them to compete.\nObtaining a licence involves a series of administrative tasks but, more importantly, fighters must also pass brain scans, medicals and blood-testing.\nBoth Benn and Collins say they are healthy.\nBunce said: \"They are in sensational shape.

Trump is many things but when it comes to golf he appears both passionate and committed. His infamous Trump Links near Aberdeen, amid all its other controversies, is a magnificent golf course, built in true links style and by an architect, Martin Hawtree, whose appointment by Trump revealed a sense of the history and ethos of the game.\nJokes about Trump tearing down the iconic Turnberry lighthouse on the Ailsa course and replacing it either with a statue of himself, or something even tackier, have been amusing to read but are surely wide of the mark. Trump knows what Turnberry means in the world of golf.\nIn one sense - and maybe we shouldn't mind this - Trump's ego remains as rampant as ever. He has just landed yet another 'trophy hotel' and this, surely, has been the root of his purchase.\nLeisurecorp, the company from whom Trump bought Turnberry, presumably had to be more concerned about profit margins at the resort than Trump will ever be. He simply wants to have this bauble among the world's great resorts in his collection.\nOn top of this, Trump's purchase may actually provide financial uplift for that part of Scotland, including nearby Prestwick airport, depending how hard Trump drives the Turnberry brand and attracts people to his golf course.\nIt's a strange one: within Scotland, in one way, Turnberry can be quite a pain to get to, with its ever-narrowing road as you wend your way down that Ayrshire coastline. But once you are there, my goodness, you are in a piece of golfing heaven to match anywhere in the world.\nThe challenge for Trump is to give Turnberry an ongoing cachet and visibility to the world, whilst preserving its historic values. He might just do that.\nMr Dawson provided soothing words, and thank goodness.\nI'm not going to touch a thing unless the R&A ask for it or approve it\n\"Turnberry is a great favourite among the players and it's on the Open rota for sure,\" said the R&A chief executive.\n\"Donald Trump is investing in golf properties in Great Britain and Ireland, so he must have great faith in the future of the game, which is very heartening from a businessman of his stature.\n\"I'm quite sure, if he does buy Turnberry, he will be putting a lot of investment in.\"\nTrump in turn has doffed his cap to the R&A, happily playing the role of supplicant to one of world sport's most enduring governing bodies.\n\"The golf course itself is considered one of the greatest in the world - some rate it as the best in the world,\" said the American.\n\"I'm not going to touch a thing unless the R&A ask for it or approve it.

It would expect to host another one at least by 2020. Trump, presumably, cannot wait for the occasion, when it is hard to believe he will make himself scarce.

Healthcare has also improved, and more free elections have been held.\nOther priorities included creating a peace in a country which has almost continuously been in a state of civil war.\nAnd then there was the process of giving citizenship to those who had been denied it under the military junta - like the Rohingya.\nAs for those Rohingya who have fled Myanmar to neighbouring countries, Ms Suu Kyi said:  \"If they come back they will be safe.

And there is nothing more important for those under 30 than resolving the housing crisis,\" Mr Perrins added.\nHe said the government should take the issue as seriously as funding the National Health Service.\nI interviewed Mr Perrins on the Kidbrooke estate in south-east London, where Berkeley Homes is building 4,500 new homes - 1,500 of which will be cheaper \"affordable\" homes.\nThe Kidbrooke estate is Britain's housing crisis in microcosm.\nIn the 1960s, the area was called the Ferrier Estate, a depressing jungle of pre-cast concrete that had fallen into disrepair.\nIn the 1990s, the local council, Greenwich - which Mr Perrins describes as one of the best when it comes to backing housing development - starting planning to redevelop the site.\nIt took 10 years to achieve a \"development agreement\" for the area, signed in 2007.\nThere are 800 \"conditions\" attached to the planning permission, from the type of building materials used, to the type of energy supply needed, to the type of facilities - such as a new school and health centre - that will be provided.\nAll might be very necessary, but all slow down the system.\nThe final houses will not be completed until 2030 - more than 30 years after the council first earmarked the area for redevelopment.\nBuilding homes in the UK is a glacial business.\n\"The real issue in my view is getting land ready for development,\" Mr Perrins said.\n\"It is also about infrastructure. It's about electricity. It's about gas. It's about adjoining land permissions. It's about all the infrastructure issues around getting land ready, and there are an awful lot of those.\"\nThere are, of course, many other reasons put forward for the chronic shortage of new homes in the UK.\nOne is that housebuilders deliberately constrain supply to keep prices - and their profits - high.\nThe government is considering bringing in financial sanctions for housebuilders that do not develop land quickly enough.\nThat policy proposal could be fleshed out in a housing White Paper to be published before Christmas.\nMr Perrins dismissed this criticism of housebuilders, saying that companies like his were ready to build.\n\"We take huge risks getting sites like this [Kidbrooke] ready for development,\" he said.\n\"It's hugely complicated and we take those risks over a number of years.\n\"It also requires an awful lot of capital. Sites like this require over \u00c2\u00a3200m of capital to bring them forward,\" he pointed out.\nReturns need to be good to keep shareholders - which include many people's pension funds - satisfied.\n\"You mustn't bring in policies that are a disincentive to bringing house [building] forward,\" Mr Perrins said about any government action on fining companies that do not build new homes quickly enough.\n\"The government owns 40% of the land in the UK; they have enough of their own land to solve the housing crisis,\" he added.\nWith Number 10 and the Treasury both saying that new housebuilding is a priority, the government department responsible for delivering on housing policy - communities and local government - is under scrutiny.\nThe housing minister, Gavin Barwell, told me he \"didn't agree\" the one million new homes target by 2020 would definitely be missed.\n\"I certainly accept that at the current rate we are not going to hit it, so we need to raise our game,\" he said.\n\"But I think if you look in both our own past and if you look to some of our near neighbours, it is possible to build the number of homes we need in this country and it is my job, working with my boss Sajid Javid [the Communities and Local Government Secretary] to make sure we do it,\" the minister added.\n\"How?\" is the question governments have been asked for decades, ever since the 1960s and 1970s when house building was a public and private affair, with 100,000 council houses a year adding to the number built by private developers.\n\"I think if there was a simple answer to that question, someone would have solved the problem already,\" Mr Barwell said.\n\"I think there is a combination of things. In some parts of the country we are not releasing enough land into the system.\n\"Then often people get planning permission, but it takes too long to turn that into a home - you can't live in a planning permission.\n\"We're too slow to get spades in the ground when we've got planning permission.\n\"I think we are too dependent on a small number of large housebuilders, so we need to broaden the range of the people who are doing the building.\n\"And then we need to make sure we've got enough people in the country who have got the skills to work in the industry,\" he said.\nMrs May has been careful to avoid too many targets in her short time as prime minister.\nBut she knows the \"one million new homes by 2020\" will be one for which voters can and will hold her accountable.\nExpect a flurry of government activity - on simplifying planning rules and promoting local authority building - by the end of the year.", "output": ["Theresa May put affordable housing at the heart of her \"offer\" to voters when she became prime minister."]}, {"id": "task1290-4665df243df6432cba393a7a5c177906", "input": "John Cornwell was posthumously awarded the medal for his actions during the Battle of Jutland on 31 May, 1916.\nThe letter from the Admiralty tells his mother, Lily Cornwell, of the honour and asks whether she would like to receive it on his behalf from the King.\nIt fetched \u00c2\u00a32,500 in an auction run by Kent-based C&T Auctions.\nMatthew Tredwen, of C&T Auctions, originally expected the letter to fetch between \u00c2\u00a3800 and \u00c2\u00a31,000.\nCornwell, who was born in Leyton, then part of Essex, tried to enlist in Royal Navy at the outbreak of WWI in 1914, but was rejected because of his age.\nHe joined up in 1915 without his father's permission and following basic training at Plymouth was assigned to the light cruiser, HMS Chester.\nThe vessel came under intense fire during the Battle of Jutland, which saw the British and German fleets of dreadnought class battleships come to blows for the only time during the conflict.\nAfter the action, Cornwell who was the sole survivor at his gun, was found with shards of steel penetrating his chest, still looking at the weapon's sights and awaiting orders.\nHe was transferred to Grimsby General Hospital but died two days later.\nMrs Cornwell received her son's Victoria Cross from King George V at Buckingham Palace in November 1916.\nThe medal is the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.\nThe letter is accompanied by an official document sent to Admiral Beresford about a fund to be established in his memory.\nA painting depicting Cornwell at his gun post on HMS Chester hangs in St Paul's Church at HMS Raleigh, the Royal Navy's training base in Cornwall.\nThe scouts created the Cornwell Scout Badge for \"courage and endurance\" in light of his legacy.", "output": ["A letter informing the mother of a 16-year-old sailor killed during World War One that her son was to be awarded the Victoria Cross has been sold."]}, {"id": "task1290-6dbf235cc348498eb4be97a57190da95", "input": "The Northern Ireland Affairs committee said the \"one-sided, secretive scheme of  letters\" sent to over 180 Irish republicans should never have existed.\nIt came to light when one letter caused the Hyde Park bomb trial to collapse.\nThe On The Runs (OTRs) were republicans suspected of involvement in terrorist crimes but who had never been charged.\nThe scheme involved the provision of so-called \"comfort letters\" by the government designed to give them assurances that they were not being sought by police.\nOne of those who held a letter was John Downey who had been accused of the murders of four soldiers in the IRA Hyde Park bomb in 1982.\nThe report published on Tuesday said the people of Northern Ireland had been \"kept in the dark to the greatest possible extent\".\nIt said the lawfulness of such letters was questionable.\nAnyone already convicted of paramilitary crimes became eligible for early release under the terms of the Northern Ireland Good Friday agreement of 1998.\nThe agreement did not cover:\n\u2022 Anyone suspected of, but not charged with, paramilitary offences committed before the Good Friday Agreement.\n\u2022 Those who had been charged with offences but who had escaped.\n\u2022 Those who had been convicted of offences but who escaped.\nCommittee chairman Laurence Robertson, MP, said the scheme had caused \"further hurt to people who have suffered far too much already\".\nHe said  victims of the Troubles and their relatives had been \"let down\" by the government.\n\"If any scheme had been put in place at all, which is questionable, it should have been properly introduced and correctly administered,\" he said.\n\"It also should have been open and transparent.

But he was wanted by the Metropolitan police\nEven though his letter was sent by mistake, a judge ruled that it would be an abuse of process for him to stand trial for the murders of Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young on 20 July 1982 in the Hyde Park attack.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) was blamed for what was described as a catastrophic mistake.\nUnionists reacted with outrage. First Minister Peter Robinson said the letters were get out of jail free cards. He said they were unlawful and should be rescinded.\nDuring its public evidence sessions held in the House of Commons, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee questioned a number of serving and retired senior politicians.\nThey included former prime minister Tony Blair, who rejected claims that the letters were unlawful and said the scheme was essential for the success of the peace process.\nIn its report, the committee said it was questionable whether the OTR scheme was lawful, but said its existence had distorted the legal process.\nThe report's authors said the integrity of both the criminal justice system and parts of the government had been damaged by the stay on the Downey case.\nThe committee said no letters should have been sent out by the Northern Ireland Office.\nIt recommended that all steps should be taken to ensure that OTR letters have no legal effect.\nThe report said the public had been \"deceived\" and that transparency was key to public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system.\n\"It is clear the intention was that the people of Northern Ireland and other political parties were kept in the dark about the scheme to the greatest possible extent,\" it said.\nThe report said that during the peace process, Sinn F\u00e9in had pushed for OTR letters at the highest level and promises had been made by the prime minister.\nIt said Mr Blair put much effort into ensuring those promises were kept, but did so without telling other Northern Ireland party leaders about the exact nature of the scheme.\nThe report also accused the Irish government of \"trying to persuade HM government to introduce an amnesty for republican terrorist suspects\".\nIt said that if the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) had known about the entire scheme and had been involved in checking letters sent to OTRs, then \"it is almost certain that the Downey judgment could have been prevented\".\nIt also stated that the availability of the scheme to one section of the community \"at the whim of one political party\" raised questions about equality rules in Northern Ireland.\nThe report said the PSNI believes 95 of those who hold OTR letters could be linked to nearly 300 members and that the Metropolitan Police wished to speak to some of them.\nIt called on the government to provide the resources to enable police to reassess those cases quickly.\nPSNI chief constable George Hamilton welcomed the report's acknowledgement that \"speeding up the scheme in 2007 made it more difficult for thorough and competent reviews to be carried out and that the PSNI knew nothing about the content of letters sent to suspects until December 2011.\"\nSpeaking to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee last September, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said the government was no longer standing by the On the Runs letters.\nShe said those who received letters should no longer rely on them as a defence.\nLast July, a separate review into the scheme by Lady Justice Hallet found that it was flawed but not an amnesty for those who received letters.\nThe judge found the administrative scheme was kept 'below the radar' due to its political sensitivity, but said it would be wrong to characterise the scheme as \"secret\".", "output": ["The integrity of the criminal justice system has been damaged by the controversial On the Runs scheme, a parliamentary watchdog has said."]}, {"id": "task1290-feaa287b2996479e9980962868187187", "input": "Many British Nook owners received the news on World Book Day.\nThe UK versions of the online book shop, Android app and store accessed via Nook devices will all close.\nBarnes & Noble said it is teaming up with supermarket giant Sainsbury's to ensure that customers can still access content they have already paid for.\n\"We thank you for your patronage and are working closely with Sainsbury's to make this transition as smooth as possible,\" it said in a statement to customers.\nCustomers must take action by the end of May in order to retain purchased content, it added, with instructions to follow by email.\n30%\nshare of UK book purchases\n47% share of adult fiction\n\u00c2\u00a3393m spent on e-books\n\u00c2\u00a31.7bn amount spent on print books\nNook was launched in the UK in 2012 but the market continues to be dominated by Amazon's Kindle, said analyst Ben Wood from CCS Insight.\n\"It's pretty tragic -

Alex Shoer, of Seeder, helped to launch a business that brings solar panels to the roofs of buildings within the country.\nHe deals with foreign businesses who, say, want to make their Beijing office a little greener. The firm says it has so far erected three megawatts' worth of solar installations, with another 28 megawatts on the way for various clients.\n\"We will source the capital to finance, pay for the whole project and then sell the power at a discount,\" Shoer says. Again, the model relies on sourcing the right parts at a favourable cost.\nThese kind of installations are known as \"distributed generation\" projects, in which electricity is produced on a small scale, at or very near to a specific point of consumption.\nWithin China, distributed generation is growing at an extraordinary rate, driven in large part by farmers who use the panels to power agricultural equipment that might not be connected to the grid.\nShoer comments that he was attracted by Beijing's commitment to the solar industry. For years it has encouraged local authorities to do what they can to boost production, research and development.\nChina's rapid expansion of renewable energy facilities has since caught headlines around the world.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the country installed more than 34 gigawatts of solar capacity in 2016 - more than double the figure for the US and nearly half of the total added capacity worldwide that year.\nEarly figures for 2017 show China has added another eight gigawatts in the first quarter alone.\n\"It's a huge market,\" says Heymi Bahar at the IEA. Most of the world's solar cells are made in China and Taiwan, he adds - more than 60%.\nThe impressive scale doesn't stop there. The largest solar farm in the world - Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, all 30sq km of it - is a Chinese project. And the country recently opened the world's largest floating solar farm, in Huainan, Anhui Province.\nIt has been constructed over an old coal mine, which over the years had filled with rainwater. Sungrow, the Chinese firm that designed the solar plant, says its system automatically monitors current and voltage generated by the cells, along with humidity, which can affect their efficiency.\nBecause of the abundant water nearby, cleaning the panels - an endless task for solar farmers - will be easier, according to those behind the facility.\nThese mega projects have become possible, and indeed more common, thanks to the rapidly falling cost of solar cells.\n\"What we were all hoping for 20 years ago when the idea of cheap solar was just a dream, was that someone would come into this on an industrial scale and drive down the cost,\" recalls Charles Donovan, at Imperial College Business School.\n\"That is exactly what China has done.\"\nBut today, solar energy production accounts for just 1% of China's total energy demand. A huge 66% of demand still comes from coal, something that the country's National Energy Administration wants to change drastically by 2050 - not least because of China's well-known air pollution problems.\nBut by that key date of 2050, a very different mix of energies could be powering China, should some projections become reality. One government report even suggested that renewables could supply 86% of the country's energy needs, with solar providing around a third of that.\nCan China do it? According to one expert observer, the answer is, \"maybe\".\n\"What China is trying to do is rationalise a very large, fast growing system,\" explains Jeffrey Ball at Stanford University's Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance. Ball is the lead author of a recent report that details China's success as an innovator in the solar panel industry.\nBut as Ball points out, the revolution has not been without teething issues. For one thing, Chinese subsidies, which some argue are unsustainable, have not always been smoothly administered. The \"feed-in tariff\", for example, often offered to solar companies that generate electricity, has sometimes been paid late.\n\"The government is often a year or more late in delivering that revenue - that wreaks havoc with the financials on a project,\" says Ball.\nThe value of subsidies has recently been cut, too. What's more, China's large solar farms are largely in less densely populated areas in the west of the country, far from population centres like Beijing or Shanghai, in the east.\nBuilding extra grid capacity to transfer it is time-consuming and expensive. This leads to a problem known as curtailment - a solar farm produces, say, 20 megawatts of electricity but can only find buyers for 15 megawatts.\n\"Depending on who you talk to in the provinces that have by far the largest amount of solar production, curtailment rates are 30% and in some cases significantly higher than 30% - that's extraordinary and that's a real problem,\" explains Ball.\nWhether China can achieve its lofty ambitions for renewable energy remains to be seen - but it has certainly proved its ability to foster a world-leading solar industry. For US entrepreneurs like Geof Moser, that's enough to propel his own business towards further growth for now.\n\"The reality is that renewable energy is very cheap - especially solar energy,\" he says. \"And the reason is China.\"", "output": ["Ten years ago, Geof Moser had just graduated with a master's degree in solar energy from Arizona State University - but he didn't feel much opportunity lay at his feet in his home country."]}, {"id": "task1290-2d513142160342c68c1cf22a671a7526", "input": "Action on Junk Food Marketing analysed 750 adverts shown during the X Factor on ITV and the Simpsons and Hollyoaks on Channel 4 over 20 hours.\nIt found one in 10 promoted fast food restaurants, confectionery or supermarket 'junk food'.\nBut the government said advertising was not to blame for childhood obesity.\nThe analysis, which was carried out by researchers at the University of Liverpool, found that unhealthy food items accounted for 11% of all adverts and around half of all food adverts.\nThey said the most frequently shown adverts for unhealthy food products came from supermarkets such as Aldi and Morrisons, followed by fast food chains such as Dominos and Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC).\nChocolate manufacturers like Lindt and Cadbury and brands such as Clover and Flora Buttery were also included on the \"unhealthy\" ads list.\nThe researchers looked at adverts shown during 10 hours of X Factor programmes and another 10 hours of early evening Channel 4 programmes during the run-up to Christmas 2013.\nThe campaign group Action on Junk Food Marketing, whose members include the Children's Food Campaign and the British Heart Foundation, said children's TV viewing peaks around 20:00 but laws to protect children from targeted advertising only cover children's programmes, which tend to be broadcast earlier in the day.\nSimon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: \"Parents don't expect their children to be bombarded with ads for unhealthy food during primetime TV, but that's exactly what happens.\n\"Even when the show is over, junk food marketers could be reaching out to young people online.

He is strong, powerful, quick and he has improved his shooting a lot.\"\nRecruited by Real Madrid from Tottenham Hotspur for \u00a333m in August 2012, the Croatia midfielder was in danger of being harshly written off as a high-profile, big-money flop.\nAppearances were irregular under Jose Mourinho and some Real fans wanted him sold, with readers of the newspaper Marca voting Modric the worst signing of the year.\nFast forward to the present day and he is indispensable to Carlo Ancelotti, the hard-to-please Bernabeu crowd are chanting his name - they want Modric to wear the prestigious number 10 shirt instead of 19 - and the queue of suitors is growing. They could be waiting a long time.\nMany, including former Real sporting director Predrag Mijatovic, believe the 28-year-old is now on a par with Cristiano Ronaldo as the club's most important player.\n\"I never considered leaving Real Madrid or that it was a mistake to come here,\" Modric, with a look of unbreakable self-belief, tells BBC Sport. \"It was my dream come true when I signed for Real Madrid. I want to stay here for as many years as possible and, if it's possible, finish my career here.\n\"I really enjoy my life in Spain. Madrid is a big and beautiful city with great parks where I like to walk. There are a lot of squares and museums, historic monuments. But I'm more a home guy, I feel most comfortable there with my wife and kids. We play, watch cartoons, like all families do.\"\nModric has never been one to court publicity - \"I don't like to speak much, I rather speak on the field; apart from Real Madrid TV this is my first big interview\" - but when we meet at the club's Valdebebas training complex he could hardly be more relaxed and welcoming.\n\"It's good for the championship that more teams are involved for the title. Atletico Madrid are having a great season. Everyone is expecting them to fall down but they keep going. There are still a lot of games until the end and we have to continue playing like we're playing at the moment. It will be interesting. I think this March will be crucial for La Liga. It's always nice to have more teams fighting for titles.\"\nHis ripped jeans, shaggy hair and cheeky smile reflect a laid-back, unpretentious, likeable character who is quiet yet bubbly, private yet warm; a gentle Galactico with a kind, conscientious, intelligent personality that endears him to family, friends and the public alike.\nBut underneath lies an unmistakeable sense of grit and determination, a fierce desire to confound and triumph, all of which stems from a life of hurdles and challenges.\nModric was aged just six when his family were forced to flee their home in war-torn Croatia in 1991, moving into an army-owned hotel in the coastal city of Zadar. His father joined the military and his grandfather was killed. Money and food were in short supply.\nWith grenades falling on the local football pitches, Modric honed his skills in the hotel parking lot and there began his journey to the top, starting at NK Zadar and moving on to Dinamo Zagreb via loan spells with Zrinjski Mostar in Bosnia and Inter Zapresic back in Croatia.\nHis progress at Dinamo preceded a \u00a316.5m transfer to Tottenham in 2008, although injuries and questions about his physical stature had to be overcome before he really began to shine.\n\"I have great memories of Tottenham,\" he says. \"I spent four great years there with a lot of emotions, with a lot of love from the club and the fans. I enjoyed every moment with Tottenham. But in one moment you feel you need to take a step forward, to go to a higher level.\n\"I think it was the right time for me to go, but I will always be thankful to Tottenham for everything they did for me. I became a better player there and they pushed me to this level where I am at the moment. I will always be a fan, I follow them a lot when I can.\"\nModric politely asks if we can avoid discussing memories of his youth, but the emotion is still evident when he explains what it means to represent Real Madrid.\n\"I think 'unique' is the best word to describe your feelings to play for such a special club,\" he says. \"From the first moment I arrived here - my presentation walking into the trophy hall at the Bernabeu and seeing trophies and pictures of the legends of Real Madrid, it showed me where I've come.\n\"I feel so proud of where I've come. All I dreamed of when I became a footballer was to play for a club as big as Real Madrid. It's maybe the most famous and best club in the history of football.\"\nNot a bad move, then, for a 5ft 9ins midfielder who it was claimed during his time in the Premier League might be too \"lightweight\" to become one of the very best.\n\"People like to judge and make their own conclusions,\" Modric says. \"I never cared what other people were saying about me - I had my aims, I believed in myself and never stopped. I've been through many difficulties in my life, but all these things made me a stronger and better person.\n\"All these critics push you forward to show people they are wrong. Maybe I look lightweight but I am a really strong person mentally and physically, and I never had any problems with my size.\"\nThis is a point illustrated by the fact Modric has made more tackles (56) than any other Real Madrid player in La Liga this season and his average number of tackles per league game (2.86) is currently higher than he recorded at the end of any campaign since leaving Dinamo.\nAnd it is not only his tackling that has improved; since Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho as head coach last summer, Modric has developed a formidable central midfield partnership with Xabi Alonso and Angel di Maria, statistically improving virtually every facet of his game in the process.\nMost notable is his passing, with the 878 Modric has completed in the opposition half of the pitch in La Liga easily the highest of any Real player (Di Maria is next with 650).\nHis passing accuracy in the league (90%) is the highest it has been since leaving Dinamo and the highest of any midfielder in Europe's top five leagues who have five or more assists this season. Modric's six assists already equals his highest for a league campaign since leaving Dinamo.\n\"I had some difficulties at the beginning,\" he admits. \"I didn't have a complete pre-season - I trained on my own in London, I came later here and you need time for everything to get settled.\n\"That [Marca survey] didn't affect me at all. I knew sooner or later I would show my quality and show to everyone why I'm here, why Real made such an effort to bring me here.\n\"I had a lot of support from the ex-coach [Mourinho] - he did everything to bring me here and I'm grateful for that. At the beginning he was very helpful to ease my adaptation. By the time I was fit enough I started playing better and better. His tactics were never a problem for me.\"\nIf one moment of Modric's Real Madrid career to date resonates above all others, it must be his display after coming off the bench at Manchester United in the Champions League last 16.\n\"When I came on I changed the game, I scored that goal and after we scored another to win 2-1,\" he recalls. \"That was the turning point for me and my career at Real Madrid. From that game, people started seeing why I'm here and my career at Real Madrid was all the time going up.\n\"I think both leagues are great. For me, maybe Spain is more technical and the Premier League is more fast and furious. From the beginning to the end of the game, the rhythm is really high, it's up and down and very quick and aggressive football.\n\"In La Liga it's more technical, but I heard a lot of stories that you have a lot of space, you can play easily - but it's not the case. There is not much space, especially when you are playing away from home and you have to be also strong not only technically but physically to play good in La Liga. It's not an easy league. But for me they are both quality, I can't say one or the other is better.\"\n\"I have big trust and big confidence from the coach [Ancelotti]. From the beginning he was clear with what he wanted from me and how important I am for the team. That helped me a lot and I could show my quality on the pitch.\n\"Last season I played some good games but our results were not following and that's why maybe people didn't appreciate my performance. This season, I am at the peak of my game and we have good results. We are fighting for all three trophies and I feel really, really good.\"\nReal are level on points with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga, will face Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final after becoming the first team in history to get there without conceding a goal, and face Schalke in the Champions League last 16.\nModric feels his team have the quality to win all three trophies but makes special mention of the Champions League - Real are desperately chasing 'La Decima', a 10th European Cup - and he is also itching to end the wait for a first major trophy of his career.\nNot that the hard work would stop there.\n\"I'm living a very special time at the moment but this will only push me to give more, to not relax,\" he says. \"Because this is the club where you can't relax. What was yesterday does not work for tomorrow, always you have to improve yourself because the crowd and the club are so demanding.\n\"I don't think any club is like here. They ask so much from you and that forces you to always be at the top of your game. The pressure is huge here. But I've never had a problem with pressure, I like pressure, pressure pushes me to be better.\"\nWatch the full interview with Luka Modric on Saturday's Football Focus, 12:15 GMT on BBC One and this website.", "output": ["If you were to survey followers of Spanish football on their player of the season so far, there is a good chance they would vote overwhelmingly in favour of one name."]}, {"id": "task1290-d627ed4949a84dd3a548dfcb63191552", "input": "And with that in mind, the Northern Ireland Pensioners' Parliament has drawn up a manifesto of what its members feel are the key issues for them.\nTheir eight-point paper touches on a number of concerns that older people have, including energy costs, age discrimination, prescription charges and public transport.\nAnne Watson, a member of the Pensioners' Parliament said that withdrawing free Smartpass travelcards for older people would have a knock-on effect on the health service.\nShe issued a warning to those who will be returned to Stormont after the election: Hands off our bus passes.\n\"They think they have problems as far as health is concerned now -

He had a notoriously bad relationship with the founding father of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, when Mr Khamenei was Iran's president in the 1980s.\nThe tipping point in such disputes usually comes when someone is no longer seen as part of the family.\nMir Hossein Mousavi, for example, was a former prime minister and key insider, but he's spent the last five years under house arrest after galvanising opposition to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the disputed 2009 presidential election.\nMr Rafsanjani is still a politician to be reckoned with, but in a sign of just how much the dispute has unnerved him, one week on, he suddenly issued a retraction of the tweet that caused all the fuss.\nIt was a comment made seven years ago in an interview with a Dutch film company, he said, and it had been taken completely out of context.\nHe expressed regret at what he called the \"distortion and truncation\" of what he had said.\nAkbar Hashemi Rafsanjani\nThe war of words between the two men looks set to die down for now, but it clearly illustrates the deep tensions at the very heart of Iran's political system over the country's future.\nAyatollah Khamenei and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani are both getting old.\nBoth are starting to think about who will succeed them and how to protect their legacies - and their families - after they have gone.\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei\nAnd the politicians and power brokers around them are starting to think very hard and with some trepidation about how this will affect them too.\nThere is a very great deal at stake, and all the more so because this is all happening at a time of change for Iran as the country begins to open up after the nuclear deal.\nThe appointment of a new Supreme Leader, when it comes, will be nothing short of an earthquake in Iran.\nWhoever controls the office also controls very powerful unelected offices like the Guardian Council, which vets elections and thus wields huge influence over the political landscape.\nAlso at stake is control over the armed forces, judiciary, Expediency Council as well as Iran's gigantic charitable foundations which some estimate make up as much as 50% of the country's economy.\nIn the past, disputes between top officials were usually settled when the Supreme Leader intervened.\nBut this time it's the leader himself who is involved, and the dispute is about his own legacy.\nMany Iranians are now looking back to 1989, when the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini removed his formal successor, the highly respected Ayatollah Montazeri, from his position just a few months before his death.\nThe decision opened up a deep wound in the Iranian system that never really healed. Ayatollah Montazeri was eventually banished to house arrest in the city of Qom, but remained a focus for opposition and dissent in Iran until his death seven years ago.\nObservers point out that in 1989 the Islamic Revolution was still strong and the system was able to recover and move on.\nBut the days of revolutionary fervour are long gone, and many Iranians now fear that the increasingly bitter dispute between their top clerics could plunge the country into chaos from which, three decades on, it would be much more difficult to recover.", "output": ["As Iranians return to work this week after the new year holiday, one talking point is likely to be the serious split that has emerged among the country's top leaders."]}, {"id": "task1290-f42c0577fa5c48ab88a3fbff2b05172a", "input": "Olympic gold-medallists Geraint Thomas and Owain Doull are named in the men's road squad along with Luke Rowe.\nRio pursuit gold-medallist Elinor Barker is in the women's track endurance squad and silver medallist Becky James in the sprint line-up.\nThe podium programme is designed to support elite cyclists aiming to win medals in major competitions.\nDoull, 23, switches from the track, where he was part of the British quartet that won the team pursuit in the 2016 Rio Olympics, to concentrate on road races.\nThe 22-year-old Barker won the Track World Cup points race in Appeldoorn, Netherlands in November.\nJames claimed silver medals in the sprint and keirin at the Rio Games after a long battle with injury following her 2013 World Championship gold medals in the same events.\nOlympic podium programme squad:\nBMX: Kyle Evans, Liam Phillips, Tre Whyte\nMountain Bike: Grant Ferguson\nMen's Road: Mark Cavendish, Steve Cummings, Jon Dibben, Owain Doull, Alex Dowsett, Andrew Fenn, Chris Froome, Luke Rowe, Ian Stannard, Ben Swift, Simon Yates, Adam Yates, Peter Kennaugh, Geraint Thomas\nWomen's Road: Lizzie Deignan, Alice Barnes, Hannah Barnes, Nikki Brammeier, Dani King\nMen's Track Endurance: Steve Burke, Ed Clancy, Kian Emadi, Chris Latham, Mark Stewart, Andy Tennant, Sir Bradley Wiggins, Oliver Wood\nWomen's Track Endurance: Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker, Emily Kay, Danni Khan, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Laura Kenny\nMen's Track Sprint: Phil Hindes, Jason Kenny, Ryan Owens, Callum Skinner\nWomen's track sprint: Becky James, Katy Marchant, Victoria Williamson, Shanaze Reade\nFind out how to get into cycling with our special guide.", "output": ["Five Welsh riders have been named in British Cycling's 2016-17 podium programme squad."]}, {"id": "task1290-6fe2a9d84c4b4bd7a53f1bd7ad5d90bf", "input": "He told his party's conference in Bournemouth that leading UKIP had been like a \"big dipper\" full of amazing highs but also plenty of infighting.\nHe said UKIP had a future fighting to ensure Brexit happened and \"harvesting\" votes from Labour in the north.\nMEP Diane James was elected as Mr Farage's successor on Friday.\nShe defeated four other candidates to succeed Mr Farage, who has led the party in two stints for more than a decade and become a household name in British politics.\nMr Farage said he would give Ms James his unwavering support and would not seek to \"meddle or interfere\" in how the party was run.\n\"My job will be if that leader wants any help and advice then, make no mistake about it, I am still four-square behind this party and its aims,\" he said.\nReflecting on his leadership of the party, he said he had put \"absolutely all of me\" into it.\n\"I literally couldn't have worked any harder, or couldn't have been more determined - it's been my life's work to get to this point.

Afar resentment erupted into a civil war in the early 1990s, and though Mr Gouled, under French pressure, introduced a limited multi-party system in 1992, the rebels from the Afar party, the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (Frud), were excluded.\nThus, Mr Gouled's Popular Rally for Progress party won every seat and the war went on.

athletics World Championships in Beijing included 66 competitors who had previously been subject to doping sanctions.\nAthletics' governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), carried out more than 1,400 tests on 878 athletes - almost half of the total number of competitors - in China. Just two - Kenyan runners Joyce Zakary and Koki Manunga - failed them, although the IAAF said samples would be frozen and stored for future reanalysis as science and technology progressed.\nThese are not included in the Wada figures, which relate to 2014.\nAs well as the reduction in samples containing banned substances - or 'adverse analytical findings' - in 2014, the number of tests requiring further investigation also fell. In contrast, the number of adverse findings had increased by more than 10% between 2012 and 2013.\nWada says the fall in these 'atypical findings' is partly due to the introduction of the athlete biological passport.\nWada's results report the number of tests carried out by sport governing bodies and national anti-doping organisations submitted to its 32 accredited laboratories worldwide.\nA blood or urine sample showing a banned substance does not automatically mean the athlete in question has been doping. Some prohibited substances can be produced naturally by the body, for example.\nWada's 2014 report reveals which national anti-doping authorities test their athletes most frequently - though it does not include figures on the number of active competitors by country.\nThe Chinese Anti-Doping Agency, perhaps unsurprisingly given the country's population, took the most samples of any, with 0.4% of the 13,180 samples taken detecting banned substances, while Russia's also took more than 10,000 samples last year.\nUK Anti-Doping, the body responsible for testing British sportsmen and sportswomen, analysed 5,160 samples with 0.7% recording adverse findings.\nIn contrast, the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission, which was rebuked by Wada for its approach in 2013, conducted 347 tests - all coming back clean - while the National Anti\u2010Doping Centre of Ukraine collected just two samples, one of which showed a banned substance.\nFootball was responsible for 31,242 tests, more than any other sport. Of those, 144 (0.5%) produced adverse findings.\nAthletics provided more than 25,000 samples analysed in 2014 - 1% of those tests resulted in adverse findings.\nBoxing recorded 1.3% adverse results from just over 4,000 tests.\nThere were also adverse findings in sports less commonly associated with banned substances.\nPara-sailing had one of the highest rates of adverse results, with 13%, although that figure is skewed by the relatively small number of participants in the sport with just 24 samples taken and three adverse findings.\nOf the non-Olympic or non-Paralympic sports, 13.7% of samples collected in body building contained banned substances.\nNicole Sapstead, chief executive officer for UK Anti-Doping, said: \"Our analytical findings show an increase in steroid use, which to me indicates there may an increase of prevalence in a more general public, societal way. It is something we are very keen to engage with in our education programme and help because it is not purely about a doping issue or a sport issue.\"\nRecent allegations have claimed doping to be much more prevalent than Wada's failed test statistics imply - especially in athletics.

It is a joint owner of London's newest landmark, the Shard, it stepped in to provide funds for Barclays back in 2008 which helped the bank avoid being semi-nationalised, and has bought a 20% stake in the company that owns Heathrow airport.\nThe list of what else it owns through its sovereign wealth fund - the government-controlled investment fund - goes on. Harrods, a 20% stake in Camden market, a 26% stake in supermarket Sainsbury's to name but a few.\nAnd according to recent reports, the UK government is now looking to tap up the oil and gas-rich Middle East state for some \u00c2\u00a310bn ($15bn) for infrastructure projects.\nThe Commercial Secretary to the Treasury, Lord Deighton, hinted at the move recently. \"We have had multiple recent contacts over the last 12 months with many governments and sovereign wealth funds on infrastructure,\" he told an infrastructure investment forum.\n\"Strong inward investment into the UK economy has created or secured more than 112,000 jobs in 2011-12, a rise of 19% on the preceding year.\n\"We hope to be even better and are working with institutional investors - from banks through pension funds to sovereign wealth funds - to ensure that the deepest possible sources of capital are available to the widest possible range of infrastructure projects.\"\nThe UK is not alone in courting Qatari investment.\nDebt-laden Greece has been wooing the state, which has already invested in one of Greece's gold-mining projects. Qatar has also agreed to contribute to a fund to reinvigorate disadvantaged suburbs in France.\nAnd it is involved with some African nations to help fund charitable projects, and is looking to invest in China's capital market.\n\"Living in Qatar, it seems like every country in the world is currently targeting Qatar,\" says Iain Webster, executive director for Qatar, at the Brand Union, which advises companies on brand strategy, and whose clients include Qatar National Bank and the Qatar Olympic Committee.\nQatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifah Al Thani is one of the world's busiest leaders at the moment, according to Mr Webster.\n\"Every single week he has bilateral conversations with leaders from all over the world.\"\nThe draw of Qatar as an investor is easy to see. At a time when so many western economies are struggling, liquidity is not an issue for the Gulf state.\n\"Qatar can afford to be a long-term strategic investor and at this moment in time to have someone with the liquidity to provide funds with no pressure for short-term returns is quite rare,\" says Mr Webster.\nBut Colin Foreman, news editor of Middle East Economic Digest (MEED), points out the difference between government and private funding.\n\"It's quite attractive on the sovereign side as an investor,\" he says, \"as you're dealing with a government that has not got a financial issue.\n\"Where it becomes more tricky is with private funders. I don't think foreign banks are particularly open to that kind of funding.\"\nSo what does Qatar look for when choosing where to invest its vast wealth?\nMost investments are long-term strategic investments, but they all contribute to the Qatar National Vision 2030 which seeks to shift the country from a carbon economy to a knowledge economy.\nThe awareness that at some stage its oil and gas resources will dry up and planning for the future draws parallels with Norway, which set up a sovereign wealth fund in 1990 to ensure the country had other sources of income in a \"post-oil\" world.\nMr Foreman says investment decisions are based on whether they make economic sense, and whether they can tie back to help the domestic economy.\n\"They've bought into construction companies before. That is a logical move.\"\nBut he adds, \"Some of the others are more trophy assets and there are other considerations at play.\"\nFor instance, the country has turned its attention to football. In 2011 the Qatar Investment Authority took over French club Paris Saint-Germain, and the Qatar Foundation are the shirt sponsors of Spanish superstars Barcelona.\n\"Clearly when you buy a football club, there's a different set of rationale - it's not a basic economic decision, it's profile as well,\" says Mr Foreman.\nInward investment in infrastructure is also making Qatar a destination for foreign companies seeking lucrative contracts.\nThe National Vision's aim of preparing for \"a new international order that is knowledge-based and extremely competitive\" has led to billions of dollars being spent on bringing international university campuses - including Georgetown, Weill Cornell Medical College, and French business school HEC Paris - to the country.\nThere has also been massive interest in tenders for Qatar's sewage infrastructure and metro projects.\nBut perhaps more significantly, with Qatar hosting the 2022 Football World Cup, it is set to invest heavily in a tournament that it hopes will raise its profile around the world, and will reportedly spend up to $150bn (\u00c2\u00a3100bn) on infrastructure projects ahead of the event.\nWith foreign firms eager to cash in on the boom, Iain Webster says UK companies are already well-represented in Qatar and seem well-placed for the future.\nThe UK and Qatar have a unique relationship, he says. \"A lot of Qataris seem to me to be real 'anglophiles'. They love London as a city and are avid consumers of British brands. The more Qatar invests in London and the UK, the more the bonds that connect the two countries will be strengthened, bringing valuable benefits to each party.\"\nHe points to Qatar UK 2013, which aims to forge new partnerships between the two countries in the fields of art, culture, education, sport and science.\n\"Any initiative like that is positive for the Middle East because it's had such polarised reporting in the western media.\"\nSo with Qatari money up for grabs, both British firms and projects in Britain look well-placed to continue to benefit.", "output": ["Everyone wants a piece of Qatar it seems or, more specifically, Qatari money."]}, {"id": "task1290-4ab16092f5a544e9bb60374180be93d5", "input": "The Championship side had been without a manager since sacking Kit Symons in early November.\nSerb Jokanovic, 47, won promotion to the Premier League with Watford last season but left Vicarage Road after contract talks broke down.\nHe was appointed manager at Israeli side Maccabi Tel Aviv in June, leading them into the Champions League group stage for the first time.\nHis last game in charge was a 5-0 victory on Sunday, with Maccabi announcing Fulham had agreed to pay a \u00a3367,000 compensation fee.\nFulham chairman Shahid Khan said he had personally interviewed \"many quality candidates for what we considered to be one of the best positions in football\".\nHe added: \"Slavisa's credentials and passion for the job rose to the top through every stage of this process, and we cannot wait to welcome him to Motspur Park and Craven Cottage.\"\nJokanovic, who spent two years as a player with Chelsea between 2000 and 2002, arrives at Fulham with the Londoners 18th in the Championship.\nTheir next match is on Tuesday, at home to fellow strugglers Rotherham, who are 21st.", "output": ["Fulham have appointed Slavisa Jokanovic as their new head coach."]}, {"id": "task1290-3e05989c1f66479db683a71de035f3f2", "input": "The vehicle parked at the back gate and a team of white-suited medics carried out the first of four confirmed Ebola patients onboard.\nOne - a 40-year-old man - would die minutes later.\n\"You never know what you'll find when you open those doors,\" said Irish doctor Carrie Garavan, adjusting the protective headgear on a Sierra Leonean medic.\nThe ambulance's arrival coincided with a shift change at Kerry Town - a huge logistical operation.\nIt takes 20 minutes for each health worker to put on the elaborate protective clothing required to enter the Ebola red-zone and its 80 beds.\n\"It takes time.

control the narrative of its war against Boko Haram in recent weeks.\nIt says it has cornered the jihadists and the conflict will soon be over - in line with its mandate from President Muhammadu Buhari to end the crisis by mid-November.\nBoko Haram's eccentric frontman Abubakar Shekau has not appeared in a video since February, when he threatened to disrupt the elections.\nThe following month he pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group (IS) in an audio message and since IS also reached out to their Nigerian counterpart, Shekau has taken a back seat.\nShekau has released similar audio clips to disprove reports about his death, although the fact that he is not visible leaves room for speculation among the army that they have killed him, as they have claimed on several occasions.\nHis retreat from the forefront signifies that Boko Haram, also known as IS West Africa Province, now takes orders from the further up the IS hierarchy.\nNonetheless, there was recently room for another message to once again defy the Nigerian government, which sparked the realisation in the military that this game of cat-and-mouse was going nowhere.\nDefence spokesman Colonel Rabe Abubakar described Shekau as \"irrelevant\" and urged Nigerians \"not to lose sleep over the concocted audio rhetoric of the waning terrorist sect which is a usual antic of a drowning person struggling to hold on to anything to remain afloat\".\nOverall, Boko Haram's propaganda campaign has waned since the beginning of the year, when it used social media to promote sleek videos showing speeches and attacks.\nThe latest video, released to coincide with the Eid al-Adha festival in late September, is poorly produced and appears to show fighters praying but there is no indication of how recent all the footage is.\nIt has been two years since the US placed a $7m (\u00c2\u00a34.5m) bounty on Shekau's head but neither he nor his top commanders have been found.\nAs long as that is not achieved, the group will be able to rethink its strategy, recruit, rearm and develop new methods of operating.\nThe jihadists have shown that they can continue to inflict significant damage even with few but deadly explosions.\nIn one recent triple attack, they killed more than 100 people in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, where they were formed in 2002.\nUsing football to tackle Boko Haram\nWho are Boko Haram?\nThe global concern for the missing Chibok schoolgirls still gives Boko Haram a bargaining chip.\nThe news of their abduction grabbed the world's attention in a way the deaths of thousands before were unable to.\nThe resulting scrutiny, as well as criticism from human rights organisations, means that the Nigerian military has taken a more cautious approach to the conflict than it did in the early days, when there were frequent allegations that the military was involved in widespread human rights abuses.\nThe new chain of command means that it is now more difficult than ever before for the insurgent group to agree to dialogue with the government\nAs the conflict escalated, Nigeria needed cooperation from its neighbours to secure the borders but this would inevitably come at a cost for Cameroon, Chad and Niger.\nEach of these allies has now been attacked, as the IS militants look to extend their reach in West Africa.\nNigeria remains a priority for the Islamist fighters but what was initially a local conflict is changing.\nIf indeed Boko Haram is defeated in Nigeria, the fact that the group is now part of a wider international network means the campaign of violence could escalate in the neighbouring countries, particularly Chad and Niger, which have broader expanses of land, far more porous borders and are closer to Libya, where IS began its expansion in Africa.\nFor now, the coalition of the African Union-backed Multinational Joint Task Force should be reminded that a wane in the intensity of Boko Haram attacks says little about the strength of the group as a whole.\nWhile aiming to end the conflict, President Buhari should learn from the mistakes of his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, who gave a series of failed deadlines to defeat the militants.\nMr Buhari's government, like many Nigerians, will be hoping for a speedy resolution but by now they know better than to be naive.", "output": ["Nigeria predicts that Boko Haram

She set up hospices, soup kitchens, schools, leper colonies and homes for abandoned children and was called the Saint of the Gutters, for her work in the city's heaving slums.\nShe has also her fair share of critics.\nMaverick British-born author Christopher Hitchens described her as a \"religious fundamentalist, a political operative, a primitive sermoniser, and an accomplice of worldly secular powers\".\nIn the much-talked about pamphlet The Missionary Position, Hitchens criticised the nun's \"cult of suffering\" and said she had painted her adopted city as a \"hell hole\" and hobnobbed with dictators. Hitchens also presented Hell's Angel, a sceptical documentary on the nun.\nMuch later, in 2003, London-based physician Aroup Chatterjee published a blistering critique of the nun, after conducting some 100 interviews with people associated with the nun's sisterhood. He flayed what he called the appalling lack of hygiene - reuse of hypodermic needles, for example - and shambolic care facilities at their homes, among other things.\nThere are others like Miami-based Hemley Gonzalez, who worked as a volunteer in one of Teresa's homes for the poor in Kolkata for two months in 2008, and was \"shocked to discover the horrifically negligent manner in which this charity operates and the direct contradiction of the public's general understanding of their work\".\n\"Standing firm against planned parenthood, modernisation of equipment, and a myriad of other solution-based initiatives, Mother Teresa was not a friend of the poor but rather a promoter of poverty,\" Mr Gonzalez told me.

Incidents need to be \"verified\" by evidence before they are accepted as miracles. Often they are cures and recoveries from illnesses which have no logical medical explanation.\nFive years after the nun's death, Pope John Paul II  accepted a first miracle - the curing of Bengali tribal woman Monica Besra from an abdominal tumour - and judged it was the result of her supernatural intervention. This cleared the way for her beatification in 2003. Pope Francis recognised a second miracle in 2015, which involved the healing of a Brazilian man with brain tumours in 2008.\nMr Edamaruku has debunked the first finding, wondering how a woman could be cured by a photo of the nun placed on her stomach, when there was evidence to suggest that medicines treated her.

People in the public sector are paid more than those in the private sector - but then they're not. How come?\nLet's get a few things straight. The ONS figures show conclusively that however you measure average hourly earnings, either by calculating the mean or the median figure, public sector staff are paid more.\nThat is real life in the real world, even though it drives some people mad.\nWhat the ONS has done is look at exactly WHY the public sector is better paid (on average). As similar studies have shown before, it is mainly because the public sector employs (on the whole) better educated, more highly skilled and more experienced staff. Plus there are more big employers.\nStrip out all these things and the pay premium switches around. But that is statistical manipulation (involving regression analysis), not the real world.\nStripping out the influence of various job and personal characteristics - not just the effect of jobs requiring high levels of skill or higher educational qualifications, but also factors like age, experience, gender and location of the jobs  - then the pay difference in favour of the public sector shrank to between 2.2% and 3.1%.\nAnd if the tendency for big employers - those with more than 500 staff - to pay higher wages was also removed, then the balance of average pay moved in favour of the private sector as the public sector is mainly made up of large employers.\nThe ONS said that taking all those factors into account, then the private sector's average weekly pay rates in 2013 were in fact between 1.3% and 2.4% higher than those of the public sector.\n\"Average pay levels vary between the public and private sectors because of the different jobs and characteristics of the people within each sector,\" said the ONS.\n\"The average pay difference in favour of the public sector has narrowed since the year 2010, which in part reflects the restraints on public sector pay over this period,\" it said.\nThe top 5%\nThe figures used for the ONS analysis came from its Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, a survey of 1% of all tax returns of people in employment - but not the self-employed.\nOvertime pay was not included in the public/private sector analysis, and the value of pension contributions, company cars or health insurance are not covered by ASHE anyway.\nThe ONS found that if rates of pay were compared by calculating median pay (the middle pay point of the range of pay rates being sampled), then the superiority of public sector pay was even higher - a 35% difference.\nThat amounted to public sector staff being paid \u00a33.67 per hour more than the private sector's employees.\nThe survey results were not all one-way traffic in favour of the public sector.\nWhile those in the bottom 5% of staff in the two groups were paid more if they were in the public sector, the highest-paid earners in each of the two groups were paid more if they were in the private sector.\n\"Looking at the top 5%, in the public sector earnings are greater than \u00a331.49 per hour, while in the private sector, the top 5% earn more than \u00a333.63 per hour,\" the ONS said.\n\"The top 1% of earners in the private sector, at more than \u00a360.21 per hour, earns considerably more than the top 1% of earners in the public sector, at more than \u00a349.65 per hour.\"", "output": ["Public sector workers are paid on average 14.5% more than those in the private sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS)."]}, {"id": "task1290-9ad67b7bc19a449094b339c9f854d2f9", "input": "Adam Johnson's penalty before half-time gave the hosts an undeserved lead, after Coloccini was penalised for a push on Steven Fletcher and dismissed.\nThe furious visitors saw Aleksandar Mitrovic denied by Costel Pantilimon.\nBut Billy Jones' close-range finish and Fletcher's volley sealed the win.\nSunderland's controversial first-half penalty changed the match after the Magpies had dominated the opening 45 minutes.\nThe victory sees Sam Allardyce's men move ahead of Newcastle on goal difference and up two places to third from bottom in the table.\nRelive Sunderland's win here\nNewcastle were furious with referee Robert Madley's decision because the penalty and resulting dismissal of their skipper changed the shape of what was a crucial Wear-Tyne derby.\nThe Black Cats had been second best throughout the first half, with just three shots compared to Newcastle's 12, but were handed a route into the game when Coloccini was adjudged to have fouled Fletcher.\nThe defender ran across Fletcher as he attempted to latch on to a through-ball but appeared to ease him out of the way with his shoulder with the ball running to goalkeeper Rob Elliot.\nMadley though believed there was an infringement and, having awarded the penalty, was left with little choice but to send him off for preventing a goalscoring opportunity.\nThe Football Association's law on impeding an opponent says: \" A player who places himself between an opponent and the ball for tactical reasons has not committed an offence as long as the ball is kept within playing distance and the player does not hold off the opponent with his arms or body.\n\"If the ball is within playing distance, the player may be fairly charged by an opponent.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAllardyce has never been relegated from the Premier League as a manager, keeping the likes of Blackburn, Bolton and West Ham in the top flight.\nRarely can he have taken such a tough job on though, with the Black Cats bottom of the table going into Sunday's match on the back of a 12-game winless run.\nHe has never lost his opening Premier League home game in charge of a club though and became the fourth consecutive Sunderland boss to beat Newcastle in his second game in charge.\nAllardyce will know his side have a battle to stay up but the manner of Fletcher's final goal, volleying home a sweeping move late on, and a first clean sheet of the season will be reason for hope.\nTo rub salt into the wound for Newcastle fans, Allardyce had an unpopular spell in charge of the Magpies in the 2007-08 season.\nAnd these fans have not had much reason for optimism in recent months, with just one win now from the last 21 league matches.\nThey must have thought the corner had been turned when, after thrashing Norwich 6-2 last time out, they controlled the first 45 minutes of the derby.\nBut, following the dismissal of Coloccini, their afternoon took a turn for the worse as Steve McClaren's 200th Premier League game as a manager ended in an 82nd defeat.\nSunderland boss Sam Allardyce told BBC Sport: \"We've carried that precious piece of history on - the fourth manager to beat Newcastle in their second game as Sunderland boss.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"This was quite an achievement considering the low ebb we're in at the moment - facing a rival with the extra pressure of having won the last five derbies.\"\nNewcastle manager Steve McClaren said: \"We were the better side by a distance. We controlled it, created chances and never looked like giving away anything at the back. Even with 10 men in the second half we still controlled it.

Not one of the 10 found guilty was ever extradited.\nHeinrich Schendel and his family always denied his part in the massacre. But when he died last year, his nephew decided to act.\n\"I somehow had to break the silence in the family. I stumbled across the story of Enrico Pieri, a boy who got away and hid in a bean field after his sisters and parents were killed,\" says Andreas, a Dresden-based self-defence instructor and writer.  \"Somehow I figured Enrico would be the one to talk to.\"\nHe contacted Enrico Pieri, now 81, and ultimately they agreed that Andreas should travel to Italy for a meeting.\nOne of the few remaining survivors of the massacre, Enrico drives up to his old village in the Tuscan hills several times a week. Apart from a museum and a national peace park, Sant'Anna is largely deserted and his parents' old house abandoned.\nOutside the house, the persimmon trees planted during the early years of the war still bear fruit every winter.\nBut the only habitable room is the kitchen, where his entire family and another family were murdered in front of him.\nHe only survived because a girl from the other family dragged him into a stair cupboard. \"In my house it was all very brief, when the Germans came it lasted a maximum of 30 minutes\".\nEnrico has agreed to meet Andreas Schendel at a youth peace festival but the two men decide to have an initial, private encounter at the village church. In front of this small building 130 people were slaughtered and their bodies set alight.\n\"We hugged, and I was surprised and relieved, but afterwards when we said goodbye we could only shake hands,\" Enrico says. \"That made me realise there is this wound and it's not going to heal.\"\nInside the church, Andreas Schendel broke down as he saw the pictures of the child victims.\nThe pain of the meeting was too great for Enrico Pieri, who shrugs and says quietly \"it's difficult\".\nSharing a stage later with Andreas in front of a group of teenagers, his face lights up as he speaks passionately about European unity and reconciliation with modern Germany. But the expected handshake only takes place afterwards when prompted by photographers.\n\"This man is a saint because he is able to forgive the Germans as a public, and that's all a saint can do,\" Andreas says as he reflects on his meeting with Enrico Pieri. \"But to forgive my uncle, that's not the question.\"\n\"The 16th SS Division was one of the most ruthless units in the Germany army of the Second World War,\" says Carlo Gentile, who served on a joint German-Italian commission investigating the Nazi occupation of Italy. \"They killed 2,200 to 2,500 civilians in August, September and October\", operating a scorched earth policy as they retreated north ahead of the Allies' advance.\nNo clear reason for the Sant'Anna massacre has been given. One theory is that it was a reprisal for a partisan ambush on the unit four days earlier, a short distance away at Farnocchia. Former partisans say they were not present in the village, as they had been told by the Allies to leave.\nSome of the more seasoned members of the division had been concentration camp guards in the SS Totenkopf (death's head) Division and some had been involved in wiping out the Warsaw ghetto.\nSchendel was one of the division's less experienced soldiers.\nWord of Andreas's visit has reached other survivors, now mostly in their late 70s or 80s.\nLicia and her two sisters Adele and Siria lost their mother and two other sisters, including 20-day-old Anna Pardini, the youngest victim of the massacre.\n\"I don't know if it is a good thing or not that he comes here,\" Licia says, as the sisters lay red roses at the hilltop memorial, where the remains of every victim have been buried. \"If he wants to be here, we will listen to his story.\"\nAnother survivor, Romano Beretti, points out that, as the son of one of the killer's brothers, Andreas Schendel bears no personal responsibility for the massacre.\nBut Mr Beretti chooses not to make the painful decision to meet him. The sisters are there, and so is survivor Enio Mancini, who along with Enrico Pieri has for decades fought for justice and only achieved a symbolic Italian verdict.\nThe sisters sit quietly, listening to Enio and Enrico, who between them have battled to keep the memory of Sant'Anna di Stazzema alive.\n\"We didn't want revenge, we wanted justice,\" Enio Mancini tells the teenagers. \"What makes me angry is that these 10 officers who were convicted lived their lives as if nothing happened.\"\nLater he gives Andreas a hug and the three men stand together.\nOn top of the hill above Sant'Anna, a memorial contains the remains of all the civilians murdered on 12 August 1944. Alongside the names of his family, Enrico Pieri has added his own name and those of his wife and son.\nWhile none of the survivors remained at Sant'Anna, they still live close by, their lives always overshadowed by the hill on which their families were killed.\nAnd it is the youngest whose memories are clearest. \"It seems odd but I can easily forget something that happened maybe a couple of days ago, but I can't forget what happened here during the war,\" says Romano Beretti, who was just seven at the time.\nAllied courts set up after the war convicted SS general commander Max Simon of the massacre at Sant'Anna. But another SS commander, Walter Reder, was acquitted in 1951. He was, however, jailed for the Marzabotto massacre a few weeks later in which 770 civilians were murdered.\nThen, for 40 years there was silence until, in 1994, 695 Allied inquiry files were discovered in Rome, locked away in what became known as the \"cabinet of shame\", and the quest for justice resumed.\nAfter extensive investigation, 10 Germans were put on trial in absentia and convicted in June 2005:\nBut none was extradited and last month a court in Hamburg ruled that Gerhard Sommer, 93, had dementia and was unfit to stand trial.\n\"Until 2002, the German authorities did absolutely nothing to investigate the war crimes at Sant'Anna,\" says lawyer Gabriele Heinecke, who has fought for justice for Nazi victims in Italy and Greece. \"The prosecutors and judges of the young Federal Republic of Germany were former Nazis in the majority. They had no interest in pursuing action in which they were themselves ultimately liable.\"\nAnd as the perpetrators have gradually died out in the past decade, investigator and historian Carlo Gentile argues the justice department in Stuttgart could have worked far faster. \"I find it hard to believe that there was no intention to slow things up.

Russia has a key naval facility which it leases at the port of Tartous and has forces at the Hmeimim airbase in Latakia.\nIn September 2015, with rebel forces advancing on Latakia, Russian forces launched an air campaign which President Vladimir Putin said was aimed at \"stabilising\" the Syrian government and creating conditions for \"a political compromise\" that would end the five-year conflict.\nIn March 2016, Mr Putin ordered the \"main part\" of Russia's forces to withdraw from Syria, saying their mission had \"on the whole\" been accomplished.\nDefence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russian aircraft had flown more than 9,000 sorties over almost six months, killing more than 2,000 \"bandits\" and helping Syrian government forces regain control of 10,000 sq km (3,860 sq miles) of territory, including 400 population centres.\nThe claims have not yet been independently verified, but it is clear the air campaign turned the tide of the war in favour of Mr Assad, allowing Syrian government ground forces to regain territory around Latakia, in the southern province of Deraa and around the divided northern city of Aleppo.\nMoscow stressed that its air strikes only targeted \"terrorists\", but activists said Russian aircraft had mainly bombed Western-backed rebel groups and civilian areas.\nIn December, Amnesty International said Russian aircraft appeared to have directly attacked civilians by striking residential areas with no evident military target, which it warned might amount to war crimes. Russia's defence ministry dismissed the report as containing \"fake information\".\nHowever, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported in early March that 1,733 civilians, including 429 children, had been killed in Russian air strikes, along with some 1,492 rebels and members of the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front, and 1,183 Islamic State (IS) militants.", "output": ["Russia will continue air strikes in Syria despite the withdrawal of most of its forces, a senior official has said."]}, {"id": "task1290-eab7622f7baf43b9a7e3597b0b6fe1dc", "input": "A Dara McVeety goal in the 25th-minute helped Terry Hyland's men establish a 1-9 to 0-7 half-time lead.\nMartin Reilly converted a penalty 10 minutes into the second half after Cian Mackey had been brought down.\nArmagh had a chance to cut their deficit to three but Stefan Campbell's weak penalty was saved by home goalkeeper Raymond Galligan.\nSeanie Johnston, up against his former boss at Kildare Kieran McGeeney, landed seven points and was one of Cavan's eight scorers on the day.\nJust three players were on target for the Orange County and in the end they fell well short.\nArmagh played an outfield man in goals, Ballyhegan club man Paul Courtney making his Championship debut.\nHe was unable to keep out Reilly's penalty while, soon afterwards, his opposite number Raymond Galligan saved Campbell's poorly directed effort.\nArmagh made a decent enough start, scoring three of the first four points.\nBut five unanswered scores - three of them from Johnston - saw things swing the way of the favourites, and there were seven points in it when Reilly advanced to feed McVeety who netted from close-range.\nTony Kernan and Ethan Rafferty got the last two scores of the half, but Armagh still trailed by five at the break.\nIt looked all over when Reilly's penalty made it 2-11 to 0-9, but Armagh had a great chance to ignite the contest when Killian Clarke's foul on Campbell resulted in a penalty.\nHowever, Campbell's kick was too close to Galligan who saved and Cavan went straight up the pitch to go 2-13 to 0-12 up through Johnston.

Beaches were left knee-deep in sludge and thousands of sea birds were killed in what remains the UK's worst environmental accident.\nIt was the first major oil spill in British and European waters, causing enormous damage to marine life and the livelihoods of local people. It also led to changes in the way people viewed the environment.\nBrittany, in northern France, bore the brunt of the thickest part of the slick, and it became known there as the mar\u00c3\u00a9e noire, or \"black tide\".\nMore than 15,000 sea birds were killed. Clogged up with thick viscous oil, they were washed up both dead and alive on the shores. Future populations of some species took decades to recover.\nHeathrow's death sentence for villages\nStreet art: Crime, grime or sublime?\nWhy do people holiday in Scarborough?\nThis destruction of the birds had a direct impact on sanitation. Many were scavengers, eating rubbish which washed up on shore. That rubbish was instead left to rot on the beaches.\nThe deaths of birds and marine mammals in the first days after the spill were only a fraction of the final toll. The effects went on for years, working on organisms from the bottom of the food chain - the plankton and small invertebrates that live in sediments, through mussels and clams on up to fish, birds and mammals.\nAnd the British clean-up effort, which involved the excessive and indiscriminate use of powerful chemicals, made a bad situation much worse.\nAt the time, the Ministry for Agriculture and Fisheries determined that the holiday industry - and clean beaches - were more important than the \"very small\" amount of damage it anticipated to wildlife.\nSo more than two million gallons of a chemical called BP 1002 was sprayed on to the affected waters. Hoses were squirted over beaches, volunteers used watering cans, fishermen pumped the chemical into the sea from their boats. The Army even punctured holes into barrels of it and rolled them off cliffs.\nThe plan was for the chemical to break down the oil and allow it to disperse and be removed by natural bacteria. But instead it killed any kind of marine life it came into contact with, from seaweed to limpets to fish.\nIt pooled on beaches for hours before being washed away by the tide, making the poisonous effects even worse. A Marine Biological Association (MBA) report in 1968 said the UK's use of detergents resulted \"in the death of a large number of shore organisms of many kinds\".\nIt took 13-15 years for the treated areas to recover, about five times longer than those areas where the oil was dispersed naturally by wind and waves.\nProfessor Martin Attrill, director of the Marine Institute in Plymouth, said the British response to the crisis illustrates how different attitudes to the environment were then.\n\"At the time the Torrey Canyon went down we were still considering the sea as the main place to put all our waste,\" he said.\n\"We've had a change in mindset. At the time it was 'the environment can deal with this' and the main concern was for the ship and whether it could be salvaged.\n\"Then people started to wake up - not just to the environment, but to the fact it reduced tourism. People didn't want to visit areas where there'd been an oil spill, there was an inability to sell goods, the brand was tarnished. Now we know about the benefits of clean seas.\"\nOn the affected section of the Breton coast, breeding pairs had returned from their migration to nest when the disaster happened. The Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux calculated that there were 450 pairs of razorbills before the spill but only 50 after. For guillemots the number of pairs fell from 270 to 50.\nAbout 85% of puffins on the French coast were also killed, the RSPB estimated. Because of their low reproductive rate, it took several decades for the population to recover.\nJulian May was an 11-year-old boy on holiday in Cornwall when the disaster struck. He remembers the surf being like \"brown, frothy coffee\".\n\"On the beach itself there were thick clags of oil, great lumps of it,\" he said. \"It was spreading all over the place.\n\"More than anything, I remember the smell - the strange smell - of this oil.\"\nDr Gerald Boalch was a senior scientist aboard an MBA ship which took samples shortly after the spill.\n\"On British beaches where the detergents were used, many animals and plants were killed,\" he said. \"Spraying the detergents was definitely the wrong thing to do.\n\"It broke up the oil, which helped the tourism industry for the affected places, but the oil sank from the top of the waves to the bottom, breaking into smaller parts and being ingested by marine life.\"\nIn Cornwall, former biology teacher Richard Pearce from Treburrick has studied Porth Mear beach three times a year since the Torrey Canyon's murky load came ashore.\nHe said it took about five years for the environment to even \"stabilise\". Before that, he said, the beach was \"barren\".\nSo how had this disaster happened?\nThe Torrey Canyon had been en route from Kuwait to Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire, on the morning of 18 March 1967 when its captain took a shortcut and hit Pollard's Rock - a reef between Land's End and the Isles of Scilly.\nEvery drop of the crude oil borne by the ship seeped into the Atlantic.\nBy evening an eight-mile slick had seeped from her ripped hull. The following day it was 20 miles long. It eventually bled into a 270 sq m (700 km2) foul-smelling smear.\nAfter failed attempts to shift the tanker off the rocks, the crew were rescued by lifeboats.\nThen the British government ordered the marooned tanker be bombed, both to burn off the remaining oil and to scuttle the vessel.\nOver two days, 62,000 lbs of explosives were dropped on the stricken craft and surrounding waters, along with 5,200 gallons of petrol, 11 high-powered rockets and napalm.\nOf the 42 bombs aimed at the target, about a quarter missed. Others did not explode. And while some of the oil burned, waves kept extinguishing the flames.\nJohn Eatwell, who took part in the bombing missions, said his abiding memory was of the \"overpowering smell of oil, which penetrated the cockpit even at several thousand feet above the slick\".\n\"The column of smoke from the burning oil went up to about 20,000 ft. To continue bombing we had to dive into smoke and flame,\" he said.\nThe Torrey Canyon broke in two and finally sank 12 days after it ran aground.\nThe approach in France was perhaps less scientific, but much kinder to nature.\nThe French let the oil come ashore and then scooped it up. On their rocky beaches, the oil that remained gradually weathered and the marine life was not as badly affected.\nMeanwhile on Guernsey, the oil hit the shore seven days after the Torrey Canyon finally sank.\nThe island was heavily dependent on tourism and officials were keen to clear the beaches as quickly as possible. The chosen solution was to suck the oil into sewage tankers, transport it to a disused quarry and dump it there.\nYears later, micro-organisms were introduced in the hope they would convert the oil over time into water and carbon dioxide. However, this had limited success.\n\"I don't think they'd have ever imagined that 50 years later the oil would still be there,\" said Rob Roussel, who oversees the quarry for the Guernsey government.\n\"At the time there was no awareness about how to deal with it, and the over-riding concern was the economy, so it was all about clearing the beaches as quickly as possible.\n\"We would have expected that the oil would have all been released by now but it continues to appear.\"\nThe Torrey Canyon disaster did have some positive consequences, including the creation of maritime regulations on pollution.\nA young David Bellamy, at the time an environmental consultant, was asked to comment on the disaster - and his unique style led to a career in television.\nSpeaking 50 years later, he said: \"The Torrey Canyon Disaster was a milestone in the environmental world.\n\"It was a tragedy that [it] had to happen before the public became focussed on potential loss of natural life, in this case marine.\n\"The media images of pollution and the attendant wildlife disasters made people begin to become involved in this new ethical conservation.\n\"It also became apparent that life is more resilient than anybody thought. In general if an oil spill is contained, the marine flora and flora will eventually return.\"\nThe International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF) was set up in direct response to the Torrey Canyon disaster. It now provides emergency responses to spills across the world.\nSingle hull oil tankers - where one hole could lead to a catastrophic leak - were phased out and replaced with double hulls, which offered more protection.\nThe American owners of the Torrey Canyon eventually paid \u00c2\u00a33m compensation to the British government. The accident remains the worst - and most expensive - in UK waters.\nAs for the Torrey Canyon herself, she still rests at the bottom of the ocean.

That's eight for every 1,000 citizens - more than double the rate in the US and in the UK (the US has 2.5 doctors per 1,000, the UK 2.7 per 1,000 according to the World Bank).\nAnd many of these doctors are based in neighbourhood medical centres and, along with a nurse and support from visiting specialists, they monitor closely the health and wellbeing of every single Cuban.\nTanya Rosa de la Cuevas Hill is a specialist in comprehensive medicine and she runs a neighbourhood clinic in Old Havana. Along with her nurse, she looks after 334 families who live in the surrounding streets.\n\"Being a family doctor, I love it,\" she says. \"The first mission we have is to prevent illness. That's the wonderful thing about my job. Prevention of diseases, prevention of accidents, that's what I like best\".\nKey to the prevention model is the annual health assessment, a full health check-up which every single one of their 1,287 patients will undergo, often at their homes.\nAnd there's no getting out of it either.\n\"My nurse knows where they live,\" Dr Quevas Hill jokes. \"They can run, but they can't hide!\"\nThe data from this check-up allows the family doctor to put her patients into categories according their \"risk\". If they're healthy, the annual check-up is enough. But if they're showing signs of ill-health, if they drink too much, smoke or have a continuing health condition, they're seen much more regularly.\nIt's an integrated, whole-person approach to healthcare, perhaps too intrusive for some, but widely accepted within Cuba.\nThe aim is to stop people getting ill in the first place.\nAccording to Gail Read, executive editor of the international health journal, MEDICC Review, Cuba had to focus on prevention precisely because it is a poor country.\n\"It's much more cost-effective to treat hypertension by exercise than to do a coronary by-pass\", she says. \"It makes sense to go upstream, to catch the problem before it begins or very soon afterwards.\"\nSo in this highly centralised country, data is gathered at the local level, fed up to the second tier of healthcare, the neighbourhood policlinic.\nHere, health trends are spotted and decisions taken about how best to intervene.\nThe model has worked well and produces impressive results. But the health successes that Cuba has achieved have, paradoxically, brought a new set of health challenges, and the preventative approach is being tweaked to tackle them.\nCubans no longer die of infectious diseases because of a hugely successful vaccination programme, so people live longer. And an ageing population presents what one minister described as a \"colossal challenge for the nation\".\nAgeing, an increase in obesity and problems with tobacco and alcohol mean Cuba's citizens are now dying of the same diseases claiming lives in higher income countries: heart disease, stroke and cancer.\nIt's been said that \"Cubans live like the poor, and die like the rich\", a reference to the fact that Cuba is a relatively poor nation, yet its disease profile matches that of richer countries.\nAnd certainly patients with heart attacks, angina, diabetes, stroke and cancer are seen daily by neighbourhood family doctors.\nThe response from the Cuban government to these new health challenges is a huge investment in public health education around smoking, alcohol, diet and exercise.\nThose delivering the message, overseeing, encouraging, inspiring healthy living, will be the local family doctor and nurse.

But it is Blues up there in sixth, and Wolves in 15th.\nAdmittedly, it does not always go to plan. Rowett's side even got as high as second until their unbeaten Championship away record was ended on Saturday, by a Hull side managed by former Blues boss Steve Bruce.\nBut, after years of instability off the pitch under the ownership of Carson Yeung, Birmingham now have their dressing room in the calming hands of one of English football's most respected young managers.\nIt was on Monday, 27 October 2014 that Rowett, 41, left Burton Albion to become the new manager of Birmingham City, a club with which he had had spent two years as a player under Trevor Francis from 1998 to 2000.\nHis appointment came a week after the sacking of Lee Clark and just two days after Blues, under the caretaker management of Malcolm Crosby, had suffered their worst-ever home defeat - 8-0 by a Bournemouth side that went on to win the league.\nRowett's first game in charge was against West Midlands neighbours Wolves, who only needed a point to go top of the Championship for a couple of hours at least.\nWolves got it, but Blues were the moral victors. The immediate impact of new centre-back Michael Morrison, Rowett's first signing, helped his side hold their hosts to a goalless draw. And the contrast between the two local rivals since is marked.\nWolves, within a month of that draw, had lost five games in a row, ending their automatic promotion hopes.\nThey were to miss the play-offs on goal difference, before their best player, Bakary Sako, moved to Crystal Palace for nothing as his contract had expired.\nThey also then offloaded their most experienced central defender Richard Stearman to Fulham before being hit by the loss for the season of injured striker Nouha Dicko.\nWolves did manage to hang on to prize asset Benik Afobe prior to the August transfer deadline, but Kenny Jackett's side lie 15th in the Championship after three straight defeats.\nAnd their chairman Steve Morgan has put the club up for sale.\nBlues, by way of contrast, lost just twice in 14 league games, climbing to 10th by the end of last season - their highest finish since making the play-offs under Chris Hughton, a year after relegation from the Premier League.\nThe club has officially been open to takeover offers ever since the day of their play-off second-leg fixture with Blackpool in May 2012. Yet, when Bournemouth made a string of bids rising to \u00a35m for winger Demarai Gray in January, Blues held firm.\nGray hit the winner when Blues beat Wolves 2-1 in their last meeting at St Andrew's on 11 April - and, after their great start to 2015-16, Blues go into Saturday's derby in a play-off position.\nRowett had gained two and a half years' experience in his first job as manager of Burton Albion before being linked with other, bigger clubs. So why did he choose Birmingham City when the opportunity arose to return to the club he had represented as a player?\n\"I went to meet Blackpool and turned that opportunity down as I didn't feel as though the structure was there for me to succeed,\" he said.\n\"I'd heard one or two rumours that something might happen with Blues because of their form and I always thought that, if that came up, it was one I'd be seriously interested in.\n\"The first game at Wolves was a big one - to get a clean sheet and change that whole mentality. But the first home game, when we beat Watford and Clayton Donaldson got the winner, that was special. I remember saying at the time that, if someone had sacked me the following day, it would all have been worthwhile just to feel the atmosphere at St Andrew's that night.\"\nRowett's best signing to date has been his first - centre-half Morrison from Charlton Athletic, who signed in his first week in charge, initially on loan.\nHaving helped keep a clean sheet on his debut, he has carried on proving a cornerstone of Blues' defence.\nThe City manager's subsequent dealings have been aimed at overseas players - largely on grounds of greater economy.\nDutch midfielder Maikel Kieftenbeld has proved the best of his summer dealings. \"I thought he'd be a good player. He's turned out to be even better than I thought,\" said Rowett.\n\"We don't want to bring in lots and lots of foreign players. But, in the financial situation we're in, we have to look at how we can get more than we can in the UK sometimes.\n\"There's two or three areas in the team that we would strengthen if we could. We are in a position that we may be able to bring in one or two new players in January, if we continue to do well.\"\n\"Yes, I deliver the final message but the strength behind me is them, as they are doing most of the work,\" added Rowett.\n\"It's not just the lads that have come in with me - Kev Summerfield (assistant manager), Kevin Poole (goalkeeping coach), Mark Sale (first-team coach), Darren Robinson (head of performance). There are other great people working at the training ground. There are some 13 or 14 backroom staff who work incredibly hard. Without people like them, any Championship manager would struggle.\n\"Kevin Poole had been travelling for seven years from Bromsgrove to Burton every day and we used to laugh at him.

St Andrew's may not yet be a fortress, but the home fans now gather with a sense of anticipation rather than foreboding.\n\"And he has turned around many individual members of the squad who had grown disillusioned and disheartened by events at the club - players such as Stephen Gleeson, Andy Shinnie and Jonathan Grounds among the beneficiaries.\n\"Rowett's recent appearance on BBC WM's Football Phone-In drew plaudits from supporters, even from fans of other Midlands clubs. And, for as long as his openness is backed up with results, he is an increasingly hot property for teams with larger budgets and urgent aspirations.\"", "output": ["Gary Rowett will mark his first year in charge of Birmingham City when his team host Wolves at St Andrew's on Saturday - against the same side he began his reign."]}, {"id": "task1290-2d06535290944cc9b2eaad33b99db7bd", "input": "Several high octane, waste-based biofuels are being tested by airlines as a way of curbing CO2.\nUN officials are set to endorse these fuels as a key part of global plans to stabilise aviation emissions by 2020.\nBut critics say the plans are unrealistic and airlines are not taking the issue seriously.\nOne of the big failures of the Paris climate agreement, adopted in December 2015, is that it doesn't cover emissions from shipping or aviation.\nThe scale and impact of carbon from the booming airline business is heavily contested. The industry points out that in 2015 only 2% of human emissions of CO2 came from aircraft.\nEnvironmentalists point out that this doesn't include the warming impact of contrails or other gases and aerosols. They believe the true impact is about 5%.\nEarlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO), the UN body that regulates this sector, produced a report that predicted a three-fold increase in emissions from airplanes by 2050 if nothing is done to restrict carbon.\nICAO has developed a long term plan that it says will ensure that, by the middle of the century, aviation emissions will be half of what they were in 2005.\nOne of the key parts of that plan is green jet fuel.\nSince Virgin Atlantic flew the first flight powered partly by biofuel in 2008, there have been dozens of tests with many different types of alternative jet fuels,  often made from oil seed crops or animal fats.\nBut in the US earlier this year, the Federal Aviation Authority gave the go-ahead to a new fuel making process that some people believe will be a game changer for greener flying.\nThe new biofuel is made from a type of alcohol called isobutanol, which occurs naturally in the fermentation process and can be found in many items including bread and scotch whiskey.\nAt a large, warm and sweet smelling industrial facility in St Joseph's, Missouri, fermenting tanks three stories tall contain a swirling mixture of wood pulp, water and enzymes.\nThe engineers here call the liquid, a \"broth\", and it's from pine-scented soup that isobutanol is extracted.\n\"It's like making a hot toddy, it has a bit of an alcoholic smell to it but you can still smell the undertones of the pine feedstock in the fermentation,\" said Andrew Hawkins from Gevo, the company that has been licensed to make jet fuel using this new method.\nThe enzymes are used to extract the sugars from the pine. Genetically modified yeast then deliver the isobutanol from the sugars. By this stage, the smell of pine has long departed and the clear liquid remaining has the breathtaking whiff of a high-octane fuel.\nOne more refining step, at another facility, is required to complete the process.\nWhat's making airlines excited about using isobutanol based fuel is the fact that it is much more powerful than ethanol, the current biofuel of choice for transport.\nAnother attraction is that unlike, ethanol, jet fuel made from isobutanol can be carried and mixed in the same pipes and fuel trucks as petroleum products.\nBy using forest residue, supporters believe the new fuel can make a real and sustainable difference to airline carbon emissions as trees soak up CO2 as they grow and it is only the waste from their harvesting that's used in production.\n\"We are short cutting mother nature and sucking carbon directly out of the atmosphere, that maybe yesterday's plane put into the atmosphere,\" Andrew Hawkins told BBC News.\n\"We then create sugars via these trees and then turn that back into fuel.\"\nGevo say they are planning to increase production to around 1 million gallons this year.\nThe company believe they can reduce the cost of production to around $3 a gallon - but that is still around $1.80 more than the current market price of petroleum based jet fuel.\nIsobutanol made from corn is now being been used in test flights by Alaska Airlines in blends of up to 30% with regular fuel.\nBut whether they are made from wood waste or corn, the financial cost of these new fuels are likely to prove a major problem according to environmentalists.\n\"They are far too expensive, and they are not delivering the emissions reductions that would justify the investment,\" said Bill Hemmings of campaign group Transport & Environment.\n\"The new fuels are two or three times the cost of existing jet fuels, no-one in their right mind would pay that price. People continue to bang that drum about new biofuels, but they are not going to deliver. It's all fairytale stuff.\"\nAttempts to regulate airline emissions have proved very difficult as countries haven't been able to agree on the ways of measurement and responsibility. For example, if an airplane owned by a Middle Eastern airline flies from a poor African country to a poor Asian destination, who should \"own\" these emissions?\nICAO believe they have found a way forward that would allow airlines to offset emissions in the future by purchasing credits from certified reduction schemes, such as tree planting.\nBut their long-term goal of halving the level of 2005 emissions by 2050 depends on a rapid uptake of green fuels.\nCritics say that this is impossible - it would require around 170 large scale bio-refineries to be built every year between 2020 and 2050, at a cost of up to $60bn a year.\nAs well as biofuels, UN officials meeting in Montreal in September will also announce tougher standards for new aircraft designs to curb CO2 that will come into force in 2028. Green campaigners say this approach is \"incredibly weak\".\nThey say that around 15% of aircraft flying today perform better than these future criteria.\nReal change, they argue, won't come through these vague international efforts. They believe that the key to solving the problem lies in the US.\n\"The US is the 800 pound gorilla of carbon pollution in the sky,\" said Vera Pardee a lawyer with the Centre for Biological Diversity.\n\"More than 30% of all international carbon pollution comes from the United States.\n\"It is the duty of the US to get us out of this problem.

A high-speed scanner above a moving conveyor belt can identify the infrared signature of an individual plastic particle within a hundredth of a second.\nAn air jet then nudges the plastic off the conveyor belt, to join other polymers of the same sort.\nOne to two tonnes of mixed plastics now can be sorted per hour, says Mr Freegard, and then sold on, to be melted and fashioned into new products.\nBut recycling is still in its infancy, relatively speaking, and struggling to cope with the mountains of trash we produce, a lot of it from electrical and electronic gadgets.\nLess than 16% of this e-waste is currently recycled or reused, and the amount being produced is growing quickly, up a third over four years according to the UN's Step Initiative.\nMuch of it ends up in places like Guiyu in China, and Agbogbloshie, a suburb of Ghana's capital Accra, where workers can become ill from the toxins, such as lead, mercury, and arsenic, found in mobile phones and other gadgets.\nSo researchers are working on electronic circuit boards that can dissolve in water.\n\"We discovered early in 2012 that silicon itself is water soluble,\" says Professor John Rogers of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, although it dissolves very slowly.\nCircuit boards are generally 1mm thick, but only the surface is used to transport charge. So a circuit board of 100 nanometres - roughly a hair's breadth - can do the same job, but dissolve in a landfill site in three to six months, says Prof Rogers.\nThe concept has attracted attention in medical and military circles, he says, and about 12 research groups around the world are now making \"really substantial\" efforts in the field.\nMobile phone batteries are also potentially poisonous and difficult to recycle, but Joost de Kluijver, operations director at Dutch-based mobile phone recycler Closing the Loop, says new technologies are helping to alleviate the problem.\nFor example, Umicore has built a plant in Belgium that can smelt lithium-ion batteries at very high temperatures and extract the metals from the molten slag.\nWhile in Germany, Accurec, has developed a way of extracting lithium using a vacuum.\nNature could even come to the rescue.\n\"A few bacteria, not many, have naturally developed the ability to precipitate out metals, in the form of nanoparticles,\" says Dr Louise Horsfall, a biotechnology lecturer at the University of Edinburgh.\nDr Horsfall is now genetically engineering them to process metals more effectively.\nBut as the developing world grows more industrial and urban, and the amount of waste we produce continues to rise, it's hard to see how such technologies alone will be enough to stem the tide.\nFor that, we'll need a fundamental rethink about the way we manufacture things and the materials we use.\nFollow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter.", "output": ["In Disney's 2008 animation Wall-E, the eponymous robot is left behind on a deserted Earth to clean up the waste mankind left behind."]}, {"id": "task1290-2356651c921248d7a3bd7cd1d85dc7b3", "input": "The man was detained near Casablanca on Friday, the interior ministry said, and had travelled from Syria via Turkey, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nHe had fought in Syria with al-Nusra front before joining so-called Islamic State, Morocco said.\nThe Paris attacks of 13 November killed 130 people.\nThey are believed to have been at least partly planned in Brussels, and Belgian police have arrested several people as part of their investigation.\nWho were the Paris attackers?\nParis attacks: Who were the victims?\nParis attacks: What happened on the night\nThe Moroccan interior ministry's statement did not name the suspect, but gave his initials in Arabic, which could be translated as either GA or JA.\nThe statement said the man, arrested in Mohammediya, had travelled to Syria \"with one of the suicide bombers of Saint-Denis\".\nFrench police raided a flat in the Saint-Denis district of Paris five days after the attacks, searching for the suspected ringleader, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian national.

is open to athletes with a physical disability and classification is broken up into two classes:\nW1: Wheelchair users with impairment in all four limbs with either a clear loss of muscle strength, co-ordination or range of movement.\nOpen:  This class is eligible for wheelchair users where their arms show normal function but the trunk and legs are strongly affected. Some athletes in this class may choose to compete standing but require some support because the impairment they have affects their balance.\nAll impairment groups can compete in athletics but a system of letters and numbers is used to distinguish each class.\nA letter F is for field athletes, T represents those who compete on the track, and the number shown refers to their impairment.\n11-13: Track and field athletes who are visually impaired. Blind athletes compete in class 11, wear compulsory blindfolds and run with a guide runner. Athletes in class 12 are visually impaired but running with a guide is optional.\n20: Track and field athletes who are intellectually impaired. Athletes in this class have difficulty with reaction time and memory recognition during an event. There are three events for men and women in the Rio programme - 1,500m, long jump and shot put- these particular events have been medically proven to have an impact on performance for T/F20 competitors.\n31-38: Track and field athletes with cerebral palsy or other neurological conditions that affect muscle co-ordination and control. Athletes in classes 31-34 compete in a seated position (using a racing or throwing chair), while athletes in classes 35-38 compete standing.\n40: Track and field athletes with short stature (also known medically as dwarfism).\n42-47: Track and field amputees. In classes 42-44 the legs are affected and in class 45-47 the arms are affected. Athletes in these classes compete standing and do not use a wheelchair.\nT51-54: Wheelchair track athletes. Athletes in class 51-52 are affected in both lower and upper limbs. T53 athletes have fully functioning arms but have no trunk function at all, while T54 athletes have partial trunk and leg functions.\nF51-58: Wheelchair field athletes. Athletes in F51-54 classes have limited shoulder, arm and hand functions and no trunk or leg function, while F54 athletes have normal function in their arms and hands. In the F55-58 classes the trunk and leg function increases.\nBoccia (a bowling game) is open to athletes with cerebral palsy and other severe physical disabilities (eg muscular dystrophy) who compete from a wheelchair, with classification split into four classes.\nBC1: Players with cerebral palsy who are able to use their hands or feet to consistently propel a ball into play. BC1 athletes may have an aide on court to pass them their ball before each shot but do not use assistive devices.\nBC2: Players with cerebral palsy who are able to use their hands to consistently propel a ball into play and have greater functional ability than a BC1 athlete.\nBC3: Players with cerebral palsy or other impairments in all four limbs who are unable to throw or kick a ball into play. The athletes are permitted to use an assistive device such as a ramp to propel the ball into play and are supported by an assistant who adjusts the ramp on the instructions of the player.\nBC4: Players who do not have cerebral palsy but have another impairment in all four limbs and have similar functional ability to BC2 athletes. Conditions such as muscular dystrophy, spina bifida and tetraplegia will fall under this classification.\nAll athletes with physical impairments are eligible to compete in canoeing using a kayak with a double blade paddle. They are grouped into three sport classes.\nKL1: Athletes in this sports class have no or very limited trunk and no leg function.\nKL2: Athletes in this sports class have partial trunk and leg function; they are able to sit upright in the kayak. Along with this, they will have limited leg movement during paddling.\nKL3: Athletes in this sports class have trunk and partial leg function and are usually able to use at least one prosthetic\nCycling is open to amputees, \"les autres\" (athletes whose impairment does not fall under one of the other categories), athletes with cerebral palsy and visually impaired athletes, competing in individual road race and track events.\nAthletes with physical impairments either compete on bicycles (road and track), handcycles or tricycles (road only).\nB1-2 classes: Visually impaired athletes compete on tandem bikes with a sighted guide.\nHandcycle sport classes H1-5: Cyclists in H1-4 compete in a reclined position. H1 athletes have no trunk or leg function and limited arm function while H3 athletes have no leg function but good trunk and arm function. H5 athletes sit on their knees and use their arms and trunk.\nTricycle T1-2: Races for athletes who are unable to ride a bicycle because of a condition affecting their balance and co-ordination. Athletes in the T1 class have more serious co-ordination problems then T2 athletes.\nBicycle C1-5: Cyclists may have a condition like cerebral palsy or have a leg or arm amputation. C1 athletes have the most severe limitation while C5 athletes meet the minimum impairment criteria. For example, an athlete with a double leg amputation would compete in the C3 class, while an athlete with a single leg amputation would compete a class higher in C4.\nAll impairment groups can take part in equestrian sport with Para-dressage the only event on the Paralympic programme.\nRiders are divided into five grades.\nGrade Ia: Severely disabled riders with impairments of all limbs and poor trunk control who usually use a wheelchair in daily life.\nGrade Ib: Riders with either severely reduced trunk control and minimal upper limb conditions or moderate upper and lower limb and trunk conditions. Most use a wheelchair in daily life.\nGrade II: Riders have a very limited ability in both lower limbs and a good trunk balance, or milder limitations in upper and lower limbs with reduced trunk control. Some use a wheelchair in daily life.\nGrade III: Ambulant riders (those able to walk independently) who have impairments in both arms or have no arms, or moderate impairments of all four limbs. This category also includes blind riders and those with conditions such as dwarfism.\nGrade IV: Ambulant athletes with either impaired vision or reduced motion or muscle strength or impaired arm or leg function.\nFive-a-side football is played by those with a visual impairment.\nAll players in the five-a-side game must wear eyeshades except the goalkeeper, who is sighted but cannot leave the area. There are no offside rules.\nThe football contains ball bearings to produce a noise when it moves.\nSeven-a-side football is played by athletes with cerebral palsy or a subsequent brain injury.\nPlayers are classified into one of the following groups; the C5, C6, C7 or C8 divisions, decided by the player's level of limb control and co-ordination problems when running.\nAll classes are comprised of ambulant athletes. Those in class five are least physically able; those in class eight are minimally affected.\nAt least one C5 or C6 class athlete must be on the field at all times and a team is not allowed to have more than two C8 players on the field.\nGoalball is played by visually impaired athletes and a special rule means there is no need for classification.\nParticipants wear black-out masks to ensure everyone, whether blind or visually impaired, competes equally. The masks are checked during the game.\nThe ball has bells inside it to help to orientate the players and, as a result, the game is played in total silence.\nJudo is contested by visually impaired athletes only. There is no categorisation as competitors are divided by weight in the same way as able-bodied athletes.\nThe main difference is that athletes begin the bout \"gripped up\" (holding each other) rather than apart.\nPowerlifting is open to all athletes with a physical disability and is classified by weight alone.\nPowerlifters competing at the Paralympics have disabilities in their lower limbs or hips, including paralysis, cerebral palsy and lower limb amputation.\nBoth male and female competitors take part in 10 separate weight classes.\nRowing is divided into four classes made up of letters to identify which body parts athletes are able to use when rowing.\nAS (arms and shoulders): Athletes have full movement in their arms and shoulders with limited or no leg function e.g. spinal cord injuries.\nTA (trunk and arms):  Athletes with a good level of trunk and arm movement. These athletes are not able to utilise a sliding seat when rowing.\nLTA (legs, trunk and arms):  Open to athletes with an impairment but who have movement in the legs, trunk and arms. This class can also include the visually impaired.\nSailing is a multi-impairment sport where athletes from the amputee, cerebral palsy, visually impaired, wheelchair and les autres groups can compete together.\nThere are three sailing classes: the Sonar, which is a mixed three-person crew, the Skud-18, a mixed two-person class, and the 2.4mR event, which is operated by a single person.\nCompetitors are ranked according to a points system from one to seven, where low points are given to severe conditions and high points for the moderately able competitors.\nEach crew of three is allowed a maximum of 14 points between them.\nIn the Skud-18 category, one sailor has a more severe level of impairment (equivalent to a class one or two) while the other must have a minimum level of impairment that prevents them competing on equal terms with able-bodied sailors.\nSingle-handed sailors must have that same minimum level of impairment.\nShooters are divided into wheelchair and standing groups.\nThese divisions are split into six sub-classes, each of which determines the type of mobility equipment the competitor is allowed to use.\nSH1: For pistol and rifle competitors who do not require a shooting stand. Athletes in this class usually have an impairment in one limb. Athletes can choose to compete sitting or standing.\nSH2: For rifle competitors who have an impairment in their arms and therefore require a shooting stand. Most competitors in this class compete in a wheelchair.\nSitting volleyball is contested by athletes with a physical impairment with the majority being amputees.\nThere are two classes called Minimally Disabled (MD) and Disabled (D) and a team may only have one MD player on the court while the other five players have to be classed as D.\nExamples of a Minimally Disabled player include anterior cruciate ligament injuries and missing fingers.\nSwimming is the only sport that combines the conditions of limb loss, cerebral palsy (co-ordination and movement restrictions), spinal cord injury (weakness or paralysis involving any combination of the limbs) and other disabilities (such as dwarfism and major joint restriction conditions) across classes.\n1-10: Allocated to swimmers with a physical impairment. The lower the number, the more severe the impairment.\n11-13: Allocated to swimmers with a visual impairment.\n14: Allocated to swimmers with an intellectual impairment.\nThe prefix S denotes the class for freestyle, backstroke and butterfly. SB denotes the class for breaststroke, and SM denotes the class for individual medley.\nThe prefix and class number provide a range of classifications, from swimmers with severe disability (S1, SB1, SM1) to those with minimal disability (S10, SB9, SM10).\nIn any one class, swimmers may start with a dive or already in the water. This is taken into account when classifying an athlete.\nSwimmers may have a classification that varies according to their event - for example, it may change between breaststroke and backstroke, according to the effect of their movements on the event in question.\nTable tennis is played by athletes with a physical or intellectual disability divided into 11 classes.\n1-5: Athletes competing from a wheelchair, with class one the most severely impaired and class five the least impaired.\n6-10: Ambulant athletes, with class six the most severely impaired and class 10 the least.\n11: Athletes with an intellectual impairment.\nTriathlon was accepted onto the Paralympic programme for the 2016 Games in Rio and it consists of a 750m swim, a 20km cycle and a 5km race to the finish line.\nThe sport is divided into five classes for both men and women.\nPT1: This class is for wheelchair users. They swim, cycle using a hand-bike and complete the 5km run in a racing wheelchair.\nPT2-4: These classes are for ambulant athletes whose impairments include loss of muscle strength, range of movement and loss of limbs. They can cycle using approved adaptations and run with or without the use of prosthetics.\nPT5: This class is for visually impaired athletes who have the option to ride a tandem cycle and run with a guide.\nBasketball is open to wheelchair athletes, whose impairments may include paraplegia, lower limb amputation, cerebral palsy and polio.\nAthletes are classified according to their physical ability to complete all tasks related to a basketball game.\nAll players are given a points rating between 1.0 and 4.5 - a 1.0 point player equates to the most severe impairment, 4.5 to the least.\nEach team fields five players but the rating of each player must not exceed a total of 14 points at any time on court.\nFencing is open to wheelchair athletes, whose impairments may include spinal cord injuries, lower limb amputation and cerebral palsy and whose conditions prohibit them from competing against standing, able-bodied fencers.\nAthletes competing in this event are split into two classes.\nCategory A: Athletes with good balance and recovery, and full trunk movement with a fully functioning fencing arm. Not all athletes in this class use a wheelchair in daily life.\nCategory B: Athletes with poor balance and recovery, but full use of one or both upper limbs. The fencing arm they use may be affected and usually support themselves with their non-fencing arm while in action.\nWheelchair rugby athletes are classified using a points system, with the most severely impaired athletes being graded at 0.5 points, rising to 3.5 points for the more able.\nEach team is comprised of four players and is allowed a maximum of eight points on court at any one time.\nTennis is played from a wheelchair with two classes - open and quad (players in this class have impairments in three or more limbs).\nIn wheelchair tennis competitions, players are allowed two bounces of the ball, the first bounce being within the bounds of the court.\nPlayers in the quad class have a severe impairment in their legs with some level of impairment in their playing arm. Most players in this class usually attach the racket to their hand using a strap.\nThe open class is for all other physically impaired athletes that use a wheelchair but some athletes in this class do not use a wheelchair in daily life.", "output": ["The 2016 Paralympics in Rio involves 22 sports but not all disability categories can compete in each event."]}, {"id": "task1290-fa19c3a1564d4dc8bf1f8381bd4fb0ff", "input": "Now with oil at a 12 year low, below $30 a barrel, how can airlines possibly be hitting passengers with a surcharge for jet fuel?\nThe point is they aren't.\nBut before you crack open the champagne and book a quick flight off to the Maldives - those surcharges haven't gone away.\nThey're just not for fuel any more. They're for - well it's not quite clear what they are for, apart from maintaining profit margins at the airlines.\nTo recap: the surcharges were introduced as a way for the airlines to distance themselves from the rising cost of oil, in the same way that they itemised government taxes on their bills.\nTravel writer Simon Calder explains: \"It was a way for the airline to say \"this is nothing to do with us - don't blame us for the price rises\".\nEven when oil prices began to fall, for a while fuel surcharges were still acceptable because the airlines had hedged, buying much of that oil when the price was high.\n\"And let's not forget the oil price is paid in dollars and the dollar has been very strong over the last year,\" he adds.\nThat has meant that savings have been slow to come through. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reckons the final hedges which locked airlines into higher than market oil prices will unwind by mid-2016.\nEven so, as the oil price raced downwards, the surcharge became virtually impossible to defend.\nAnd, more important, the regulators were not going to let the airlines hoodwink their passengers.\nIn 2012 the US Department of Transportation had ruled: \"When a cost component is described as a fuel surcharge \u2026 that amount must actually reflect a reasonable estimate of the per-passenger fuel costs incurred by the carrier\".\nSo bit by bit the fuel surcharge has disappeared.\nHas that meant fares have come down?\nIATA's chief economist Brian Pearce says: \"In 2015 air ticket prices on average still fell by around 5% (adjusted for exchange rate changes) and we expect similar reductions in 2016.\n\"That's a substantial reduction because at the same time airlines are seeing the costs like labour and airport charges going up.\"\nBut the interesting point is how the airlines have removed the surcharge.\nSome airlines like Qantas and Virgin Australia did get rid of it altogether and absorbed it into their basic fare early last year.\nMany of the budget airlines, such as Ryanair, boasted that they never had a fuel surcharge in the first place.\nA few held on to it, most notably in Japan where it is strictly regulated, and accurately reflects the falling cost.\nSo the fuel surcharge for a JAL flight from Japan to Korea at the beginning of 2015 stood at 1,000 yen (\u00a35.80; $8.40). A year later and it has sunk to 300 yen.\nBut many of the other airlines simply removed the fuel surcharge and replaced it with something different, often described as a \"carrier imposed surcharge\".\nWhat that means is not exactly clear.\nFor instance BA's explanation of the charge is as follows: \"Carrier imposed charges were introduced in October last year in response to a variety of factors.\n\"These include changing industry practices and to be consistent with changes that have been in place for flights originating in the USA for a number of years.\"\nLufthansa is slightly more illuminating. It introduced an \"international surcharge\" in 2014.  Spokesman Boris Ogursky says: \"The surcharge covers costs beyond our control such as air traffic control fees, emissions trading scheme payments and so on.\n\"It is important for the customer to compare the overall cost of the flight with other airlines. The total fare is steered by market competition - it's not just us making up surcharges and putting them up and down as we like.\n\"It is a highly competitive marketplace.\"\nIn some respects the name of the surcharge is irrelevant. As Simon Calder says: \"You could call it a uniform charge if you want, and you can say it's to cover the cost of uniforms, it matters not a jot.\n\"It is just another way of charging the passenger.\"\nHowever, it does matter to frequent flyers. In general, frequent flyer points can only be redeemed in exchange for basic fares. Surcharges and government taxes, with some exceptions, have to be paid for with cash.\nSo, by framing a large chunk of the fare as a surcharge, airlines can protect that income from discounts and loyalty scheme claims.\nThe bottom line could come as a bit of a shock to a frequent flyer eagerly queuing up to redeem points to buy a British Airways round trip to New York, say.\nIf they leave early this Saturday and come back on Wednesday, they will be faced with a total fare of \u00a3523.55.\nOf that \u00a3155 is government taxes. No chance the frequent flyer points (known as Avios to BA customers) will pay for that.\n\u00a3163 of the fare is the carrier imposed surcharge. The points won't pay for that either - unless there is a special offer available.\nIn the end the points will pay for just \u00a3205 of the \u00a3523.55 fare. The frequent flyer (not the points) ends up paying the rest.", "output": ["Remember the fuel surcharge imposed by the airlines when oil prices started to rise?"]}, {"id": "task1290-766480e2114b4b788591e6a1e8799853", "input": "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has accused Actavis UK of breaking competition law by raising the price for 10mg hydrocortisone tablets from 70p to \u00a388 over eight years.\nHydrocortisone treats life-threatening conditions such as Addison's disease.\nActavis UK's current owner, Teva, said it would defend the allegations.\nBetween 2008 and 2015, the CMA claims that the NHS's spending on the drug rose from \u00a3522,000 to \u00a370m.\nActavis UK acquired the rights to make generic hydrocortisone tablets in 2008 from Merck Sharp & Dohme, which had produced a branded version of the treatment.

The DNA profile was incomplete, however, and he was acquitted at Winchester Crown Court in 2012.\nWith no other suspects, the case was about to be effectively shelved in 2013 when Det Insp Martin Chudley, of Hampshire Constabulary, led a final review of the evidence.\n\"I always felt it was impossible that he left nothing behind,\" he said.\n\"It was a long, prolonged attack, he was there for quite some considerable time - I just couldn't conceive there wasn't a part of him there somewhere.\"\nForensic samples taken from Mrs Edmonds' trousers and the rolling pin had been thought to be the most likely to yield the killer's DNA as those were items which had clearly been touched.\nHamlen's DNA had been found on the rolling pin but had been mixed with that of Mrs Edmonds. This meant a full profile may have been there but was masked by their shared characteristics.\nAfter the acquittal, Det Insp Chudley asked scientists to re-examine samples taken from the original murder scene.\nHe was told it was \"unlikely to work\", but the team decided to examine some of the fibres from the back left sleeve of Ms Edmond's blouse. It proved crucial and in February 2014, a full profile of Hamlen's DNA was identified.\nThe Court of Appeal subsequently quashed the original not guilty verdict, paving the way for Hamlen, 36, to be put on trial for murder for a second time.\nThis time the DNA evidence was strong enough, along with mobile phone evidence, for the prosecution to place him at the murder scene.\nHis mobile phone had been used nearby, close to the time of the murder, and again near to where Mrs Edmonds' mobile had been switched on and then discarded.\nForensic scientist Geraldine Davidson told jurors the material found on the blouse was 26 million times more likely to have come from Hamlen than someone else.\nThe prosecution alleged he had targeted her for her money. Hamlen had a history of domestic violence and cocaine use, was suspected of dealing drugs and was thought to be considerably in debt.\nHowever, he flatly denied any involvement in the killing.\n\"I know I didn't do this, I could not do something like this,\" he told the court. \"As far as the DNA goes, I'm not an expert.

It was young love personified.\n\"They were so young and so fresh-faced. They were these wonderful Scottish fair complexions with rosy cheeks. They were wild-eyed and they could sure scream loud.\"\nFields and Strauss Klenfner were witnessing the high-point of Rollermania in the UK, with number one singles, sell-outs tours, the band's own TV show and thousands of hysterical tartan-clad teenage fans screaming at them wherever they went.\nBut getting to that point had not been easy.\nIt had been nine years since two Edinburgh brothers - Alan and Derek Longmuir - had formed a band with their school mates.\nThe Saxons decided they wanted a more American-sounding name and stuck a pin in a map of the US, landing in Bay City, Michigan.\nPersonnel changes and the arrival of local pop promoter Tam Paton as their manager drove the band on as they gathered a loyal following around Edinburgh.\nBy 1971, Paton had landed the Rollers a deal with Bell records and they had a hit single, \"Keep on Dancing\", which crept up the charts to number nine.\nAlan Longmuir says: \"It was brilliant. We were just young guys. I was a plumber to-trade, my brother was a joiner, Nobby, the singer, was a joiner.\"\nBut it was a false dawn and their next two singles failed to make the charts.\nPaton made changes to the line-up and to the band's look but by the end of 1972 the Rollers were starting to look like a one-hit wonder.\nBell Records brought in hit-makers Phil Coulter and Bill Martin, who had written Britain's first Eurovision Song Contest winner, Puppet on a String, for Sandy Shaw in 1967.\nMartin, who was from Govan, says: \"I was always looking for a Scottish band and I thought they were quite special. Quite different from any other pop group.\"\nCoulter was impressed by the band's \"unshakeable\" belief they would be superstars but he says the reality was they could hardly tune their own guitars.\nHe insisted session musicians were used to lay down the tracks in the studio because it would take too long to get the right sound from the band.\nAs they worked on the new sound, there were more changes in the band's line-up with Les McKeown brought in to replace Nobby Clark as the lead singer.\nAnother new face was 16-year-old Stuart Wood.\nHe says: \"I was gobsmacked. I'd only been playing guitar just over a year and probably knew about five or six chords.\"\nWith the classic line-up in place, and Bill and Phil on board, the hits began to come.\nRemember (Sha La La La) got to number six in early 1974 but it was Shang-a-Lang that kick-started Rollermania.\nProducer Bill Martin says: \"It was phenomenal. It just took off like a rocket.\"\nStuart Wood says: \"From not having anyone screaming to having thousands of people screaming at you was pretty quick.\"\n\"The noise was colossal,\" says Martin. \"They were a sensation.\"\nAccording to Coulter the big difference was the age of the girls buying the records and screaming at the band.\nThey were not 16 or 17 but instead were much younger.\n\"This was whole new thing,\" he says. \"That was the gap in the market.\"\nAt the end of 1974, their debut album - Rolling - was at number one but the Rollers were not happy.\nCoulter says the band wanted to be more hands-on, writing their songs and playing on their own tracks.\nHe refused and the band demanded a new producer.\nPhil Wainman was given the task of keeping the hits coming but the Rollers had to play and sing on the records.\n\"That was quite a task,\" he says.\nBut it was one he was equal to and in early 1975 Bye Bye Baby went to number one and stayed there for six weeks.\nWainman says: \"It was selling 75,000 a day. You can have a hit these days with just 20,000 records.\"\nThe next single \"Give a little love\" also went to number one and Rollermania took over the country.\nThe band even had their own TV show.\nAt the height of the mania the Rollers undertook their biggest UK tour to-date.\n\"That was a crazy tour,\" says McKeown.\n\"We would go on and the police would make us stop because they just could not control the crowd.\"\nThe strain of constant touring was compounded when, on a rare visit home to Edinburgh, McKeown ran over and killed a 76-year-old woman.\nHe says: \"I can remember just being in complete shock. I don't know how long it took me to come out of that shock.\n\"In retrospect I should have dealt with the issue in a much more comprehensive way.\"\nThe day after the accident McKeown rejoined the tour.\nThe Rollers management had no time to give McKeown a chance to deal with the incident, they were already planning the next stage of their global domination by breaking them in America.\nMusic mogul Clive Davis of Arista Records picked \"Saturday Night\" as their first single in the US, a Bill and Phil production that had failed to chart in the UK in 1973.\nOn 20 September 1975, the Rollers performed at London Weekend Television and were beamed by satellite into the homes of 30 million unsuspecting Americans.\nTheir performance ended with a stage invasion that left Woody and Les in hospital.\nTen days later the Rollers were on their way to America.\nDetails of their flight arrival were leaked to fans so they got a rapturous reception as they touched down.\nPhil Wainman says: \"I went out there and witnessed this unbelievable happening at JFK.\n\"It was like the Beatles all over again. In fact it might have been bigger.\"\nBy January 1976, Saturday Night had climbed to the top of the US Billboard chart.\nAccording to Bill Martin it sold 12 million records.\nDespite success around the world, the cracks were showing and founder member Alan Longmuir quit the band in April 1976.\nHe says: \"I was getting depressed. I just couldn't take it any more.\"\nNew members came and went and the hits started to slow.\nThe band sold 120 million records and conquered the UK, US, Australia and Japan but music journalist Caroline Sullivan says that by late 1977 they had declined in popularity quite a bit.\n\"There is obviously a sell-by date for all boy bands and the Rollers were reaching theirs.\n\"They had a really good run. The fans were growing up and The Rollers themselves were obviously completely fed up with it.\"\nThe band finally imploded when McKeown left in 1978 and bitter battles over the money they should have been paid dragged on for years.\nDerek Longmuir says: \"We were definitely ripped off but there was a big element of naivety as well.\n\"People would come along and tell you, 'you guys just concentrate on the music and we'll do the business stuff' and you just accepted that.\"\nBill Martin says: \"I have no qualms about saying about Tam Paton that he was a disgrace.

But maybe they should have.\n\"Young women have been excited and perhaps disturbed by things like Brexit and Donald Trump,\" says Barbara Rowlands, an associate professor in the journalism department at City, University of London.\n\"If there was a junior GQ and they put something like that up, nobody would have batted an eyelid.\"\nDr Rowlands says younger Teen Vogue readers generally come from an ABC1 readership, and will have heard discussions about Donald Trump - so naturally they are curious.\nFeminist commentators have suggested the shock at Teen Vogue publishing a coherent piece of political opinion is a sign of how badly women are under-estimated.\n\"Stop proudly flaunting your low expectations,\" advised US feminist writer Roxane Gay on Twitter.\nIn September 2016, Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka cut short an interview with Cosmopolitan.com after being asked how her father's childcare policy compared to his past remarks on maternity leave.\nInterviewer Prachi Gupta said: \"In 2004, Donald Trump said that pregnancy is an inconvenient thing for a business. It's surprising to see this policy from him today. Can you talk a little about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\"\nAccording to Cosmo's transcript, the mother of three replied: \"I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions. So I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this.\"\nShe terminated the meeting shortly afterwards.\nMs Gupta's other political reporting has included a video piece where five young women explained why they were voting for Mr Trump.\nLena Dunham, creator of the HBO TV show Girls, interviewed Ms Clinton for her feminist email newsletter, Lenny.\nThe interview was full of personal insights from a candidate frequently accused of lacking warmth, including how she felt about working in a salmon canning factory after college.\nMiss Dunham, who was a vocal Democrat supporter in the run-up to the US presidential vote, asked Ms Clinton if she had worried about marrying her husband Bill.\n\"I was terrified about losing my identity and getting lost in the wake of Bill's force-of-nature personality,\" the former secretary of state admitted.\n\"I actually turned him down twice when he asked me to marry him.\"\nIn August 2016, President Barack Obama penned an exclusive piece for Glamour magazine about his feminist views as a man and a father.\nIt was a gesture that showed he was keen to address young women through whatever media they are drawn to.\n\"Michelle and I have raised our daughters to speak up when they see a double standard or feel unfairly judged based on their gender or race - or when they notice that happening to someone else,\" he wrote.\n\"It's important for them to see role models out in the world who climb to the highest levels of whatever field they choose. And yes, it's important that their dad is a feminist, because now that's what they expect of all men.\"\nGlamour says it has 10 million print readers and 15 million unique users online.

They are part of what has become known as \"price-tag gangs\" and they are risking their safety to send a very political message.\nPrice-tagging is the term they use for a range of acts, from vandalism to arson attacks and religious desecration.\nThey carry out these crimes as an act of revenge. Primarily, they are warning their own government that there is a price to pay for any attempt to give what they believe is Jewish land to the Palestinians as part of the fragile peace process.\nBut they also say there is a price to pay by Arabs for attacks on Jews.\nThe price-tag gangs come from the hilltops of the West Bank, Arab territory that has been occupied by Israel since the war of 1967.\nIsraeli homes built on occupied land are illegal according to international law, though Israel disputes this. Israel regards the West Bank as territory whose final status is yet to be determined and has built 120 settlements here - around 300,000 Israelis now live in the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem.\nBut there are also 100 small outposts scattered on strategic hilltops some of which are illegal under Israeli law because they are built on private Palestinian land.\nThe hills are the battle ground for the hilltop youth - price tagging is their calling card and they have sworn to sacrifice all to prevent this land being given to the Palestinians.\nMoriah Goldberg is one of them. The 20-year-old was captured on CCTV in February in a Palestinian village.\nShe slashed open sacks of building materials, cars were sprayed with graffiti saying \"revenge\" and insulting the Prophet Muhammad.\nMoriah, who is under house arrest in the ultra nationalist Israeli settlement of Tapuach, in the West Bank, did not deny her actions.\n\"A 'price tag' means that when the government of Israel decides to evict a settlement, an outpost, even the smallest wooden shack in the land of Israel - it has a price. Maybe it will make them think twice before they do it again.\"\nThe Israeli government's move to label some of the price-taggers' behaviour as acts of terrorism does not faze her.\n\"Faithless Jews who don't fear God can call me a terrorist if they want. I don't care what they say about me. I only care what God thinks. I act for him and him alone.\"\nGraffiti is not the only hallmark of the price-tagger. There has been violence and intimidation: Arab cars have been hit by petrol bombs and people seriously injured. Security cameras caught the torching of trucks in Palestinian villages and - perhaps most worrying for the security situation - there have been arson attacks on mosques in the West Bank and Israel.\nOne of the most provocative price tags so far was in February in the Palestinian village of Burka, where the mosque was attacked, prayer mats were burnt, insults sprayed and war declared on the walls.\nThe Israeli authorities say they are determined to put an end to this and orders have gone out to the police and security services.\nMark Regev, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu, said the price-taggers would be stopped.\n\"If these extremists succeed - if you have, heaven forbid, a mosque or something goes up in smoke, this could promote extremism on their side and you could have a terrible impact. We've got to stamp these phenomena out.\"\nSalam Fayyad, the Palestinian Authority's Prime Minister, is blunt in his assessment of their actions: \"Certainly at least in some aspect of what those violent settlers commit - there's hardly any other way of describing it other than outright terrorism.\"\nIsrael's security forces are increasingly caught in the middle and the army has become a target of the hilltop youth as tensions rise.\nOne of the few price-taggers caught and successfully prosecuted is Alex Ostrovsky, 27, who was imprisoned for damaging vehicles in a military base.

If calling me a terrorist helps me stay in my homeland, they can call me a terrorist.\"\nAmid the price-tagging and tension over Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, peace talks with the Palestinians aimed at establishing two states side-by-side, are frozen.\nFor the Palestinians, the continuing growth of the settlements - 50,000 new residents in the last three years - remains the biggest stumbling block.\nSalam Fayyad said the price-tagging and delays over moves to evict settlers from illegal outposts are taking a toll on the peace process.\n\"I see the viability of what remains of the two-state solution... giving way under the heavy weight of that settlement enterprise and associated violence.\"\nFor its part, Israel has formed a new taskforce to combat Jewish acts of extremism and says negotiating the future of the settlements will have to be part of the peace talks which they are ready to begin, without preconditions.\nRegardless of what happens to the peace process the government knows it has to tackle the enemy within before Jewish militancy spirals out of control.\nPanorama: Price Tag Wars, BBC One, Monday, 17 September at 20:30 BST and then available in the UK on the BBC iPlayer.", "output": ["With their hoodies, covered faces and cans of spray paint, they may in some ways look like average teenage vandals out for a night of trouble."]}, {"id": "task1290-4d6b0874dc4c4a758d7ac664b86376e2", "input": "The 500-1 outsider.

And Dublin would have the appeal of being an English-speaking city - with a better reputation than Frankfurt as a place for fun.\nFrankfurt's dull image is perhaps not entirely fair. It has art museums, an opera house, and a top-flight football team. Twelve of the city's restaurants have been awarded a coveted Michelin star (although admittedly London has more than five times that number).\nFrankfurt is in many ways an easier city to live in.

Once a nominee accepts the proposed honour, the list is formally approved.\nThe honours are published in the official Crown newspaper, the London Gazette, twice a year - at New Year, and in mid-June on the date of the Queen's official birthday.\nThe Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood at St James's Palace then arranges investitures for the recipients to be presented with their medals by the Queen or other members of the Royal Family.\nPrivate nominations, made by individuals or by representatives of organisations to the Cabinet Office, traditionally make up about a quarter of all recommendations.\nThe honours list does not cover peerages. Starting in May 2000, peers nominated by political parties have been vetted by the House of Lords Appointments Commission. The commission is involved in making recommendations for non-party affiliated peerages.\nAn outgoing prime minister also has the right to draw up a dissolution or resignation honours list on leaving office, which is then submitted to the Cabinet Office for approval.\nIn recent years, however, political donations made by a number of recipients have become the subject of media scrutiny.\nIn a November 2011 response to a parliamentary committee's inquiry into the honours system, the Cabinet Office noted that all candidates for senior awards are \"checked against the lists of donations maintained and made public by the Electoral Commission.\n\"The Main Honours Committee must satisfy itself that a party political donation has not influenced the decision to award an honour in any way; the committee must be confident that the candidate would have been a meritorious recipient of an honour if he or she had not made a political donation.\"\nA Parliamentary and Political Services Committee comprising a majority of independent members and the chief whips of the three major parties was set up in 2012 to considers honours for politicians and for political service.\nBut in the same year the Commons Public Administration committee urged the government to review the way the whole honours system is administered. It called on ministers to set up independent bodies to nominate recipients for awards and decide when they should be withdrawn, suggesting the government's \"lack of willingness to clarify and open up the process\" was damaging public confidence.\nHonours have sometimes been forfeited. The Honours Forfeiture Committee considers cases where a recipient's actions \"raise the question of whether they should be allowed to continue to be a holder of the honour\".\nThe Queen's art adviser Anthony Blunt, stripped of his knighthood in 1979 after being revealed as a Soviet spy, and jockey Lester Piggott, who lost his OBE after he was jailed in 1987 for tax fraud, are among those to have had honours annulled.\nIn 2012, former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin - heavily criticised over his role in the bank's near-collapse in 2008 - had his knighthood removed, while entertainer Rolf Harris was stripped of a CBE in March 2015, following his conviction for indecent assault.\nMeanwhile, a list of 277 people who had turned down honours between 1951 and 1999, and who had since died, was made public by the Cabinet Office following a BBC Freedom of Information request. The list included the authors Roald Dahl, J G Ballard and Aldous Huxley, and the painters Francis Bacon, Lucien Freud and LS Lowry.\nThe honour of knighthood comes from the days of medieval chivalry, as does the method used to confer the knighthood: the accolade, or the touch of a sword by the sovereign.\nAlthough Knights Bachelor do not comprise an order of chivalry, knighthood is a dignity which has its origins in Britain in Saxon times. They are styled \"Sir\" (except for clergymen who do not receive the accolade) and their wives \"Lady\".\nWomen receiving the honour are styled \"Dame\" but do not receive the accolade.\nThe honour is given for for a pre-eminent contribution in any field of activity.\nThe rank of Knight Commander (KBE) or Dame Commander (DBE), Order of the British Empire, commonly appears on the Diplomatic Service and Overseas list.  It can be given to Britons based abroad or in an honorary capacity to foreign nationals.\nThe Order of the Bath is an order of chivalry and was founded in 1725 for service of the highest calibre. The order has a civil and military division and is awarded in the following ranks: Knight Grand Cross (GCB), Knight Commander (KCB) and Companion (CB).\nThe Order takes its name from the symbolic bathing which in former times was often part of the preparation of a candidate for knighthood.\nThis Order was founded by King George III in 1818 and is awarded to British subjects who have rendered extraordinary and important services abroad or in the Commonwealth. Ranks in the Order are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCMG), Knight or Dame Commander (KCMG or DCMG) and Companion (CMG).\nThis is awarded for service of conspicuous national importance and is limited to 65 people. Recipients wear the initials CH after their name.\nKing George V created these honours during World War I to reward services to the war effort by civilians at home and servicemen in support positions.\nThe ranks are Commander (CBE), Officer (OBE) and Member (MBE).\nThey are now awarded for prominent national or regional roles and to those making distinguished or notable contributions in their own specific areas of activity. The honour of an MBE, in particular, can be given for achievement or service in the community.\nThe medal was founded in 1917 and was awarded for \"meritorious\" actions by civilians or military personnel, although the recipients did not attend a royal investiture.\nIt was scrapped in 1993 by former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, as part of his drive towards a \"classless\" society.\nNearly two decades on, Prime Minister David Cameron has announced its revival, and from 2012, to coincide with the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, about 300 will be awarded annually to community volunteers.\nBy 1896, prime ministers and governments had increased their influence over the distribution of awards and had gained almost total control of the system. Therefore, Queen Victoria instituted The Royal Victorian Order as a personal award for services performed on her behalf.\nToday this honour is still awarded in recognition of services to the royal family. The ranks are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCVO), Knight or Dame Commander (KCVO or DCVO), Commander (CVO), Lieutenant (LVO) and Member (MVO).\nAssociated with the Royal Victorian Order is the Royal Victorian Medal which has three grades: gold, silver and bronze.

The annual budget presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday seems to suggest as much.\nThe government has allocated 480bn rupees ($7.1bn; \u00c2\u00a35.6bn) to a scheme which guarantees every rural household 100 days of work each year. This is the highest allocation ever made to the programme.\nThe increased spending on the programme is intended to alleviate the negative impact of the government decision to ban high value notes in rural and semi-rural areas of India. A majority of transactions in these areas happen in cash, which has been in short supply since the rupee ban in November last year.\nThe jobs guarantee programme is also intended to alleviate the impact of the rupee ban on the informal manufacturing sector which operates in cash and tends to employ many semi-skilled and unskilled people who migrate to cities from rural India.\nThe government has also increased the allocation to an affordable housing scheme by more than 50% to 230bn rupees which is also expected to create some employment in rural India.  Close to half of India's population is engaged in agriculture which contributes only around 18% of GDP.\nThe allocation to 29 schemes sponsored by the central government has gone up by 21.6% and the allocation to the infrastructure sector has gone up by 13.5%.\nOver and above this, the government has increased the lending target to a scheme that gives loans at low interest rates to micro-finance institutions and non-banking finance institutions. These in turn lend money to micro and small business entities engaged in manufacturing, trading and services activities.\nRural spending promise in India budget\nIndia admits rupee ban bad for economy\nTo cut a long story short, the Modi government is trying to spend its way out of trouble, but it is not going overboard with it.\nA part of this pump-priming became necessary because of the government's rupee ban self-goal, which is expected to pull down economic growth in 2016-2017.\nThe Economic Survey for 2016-2017 released on Tuesday, projected GDP growth at between 6.5-6.75% in 2016-2017, down from 7.9% in 2015-2016. The question is what economic growth could have been without the rupee ban.\nWhen pushed in to a corner, most governments try to spend their way out of trouble.\nNevertheless, government spending is not always as effective as private spending. In the Indian case, a major reason is massive leakage.  This means that a large portion of government spending does not reach those it is meant for and is instead, siphoned off by the bureaucracy expected to distribute it.\nOne way to tackle this is for the government to concentrate on running a few important schemes on which it can spend the bulk of its money and focus its time and attention on.\nThe Economic Survey points out that \"the Budget for 2016-17 indicates that there are about 950 central sector and centrally sponsored sub-schemes in India\".\nOne negative impact of running so many schemes is that \"in many cases, the poorest districts are the ones grappling with inadequate funds. This is evidence of acute misallocation.\"\nA very important part of economic reform in India would be to bring down the number of these schemes. But that, as they always say, is easier said than done.\nAnd as always, this budget missed out on this opportunity as well.\nVivek Kaul can be reached at vivek.kaul@gmail.com", "output": ["India's government is trying to spend its way out of the trouble caused by last year's decision to ban high value notes in a crackdown on corruption, writes columnist Vivek Kaul."]}, {"id": "task1290-05344c1135a34d2ba43cbe88086d42a0", "input": "BBC director general Tony Hall said he wanted to \"try out businesses that go direct to the public\" to boost the income of BBC Worldwide.\nThe new service, which could launch in 2016, will not affect agreements with other services such as Amazon and Hulu.\nOne expert told BBC News the service would probably appeal to a \"niche\" audience.\nLord Hall said the new service would showcase the \"best of British\" television to audiences in the US.\n\"We're launching a new over-the-top video service in America offering BBC fans programmes they wouldn't otherwise get - showcasing British actors, our programme-makers - and celebrating our culture,\" he said in a speech on Thursday.\nOver-the-top services distribute television programmes through the open internet without a traditional cable or satellite provider controlling the content.\nA BBC spokeswoman said its programmes would still broadcast on US TV channels, and that the new service was not designed to compete with products such as Netflix, which stream content from a number of partners.\n\"The subscription service will complement our existing footprint in the USA.

It ultimately cost her a major and her second ANA Inspiration title.\nIf Thompson's actions were not spotted by her playing partner, referees on the spot, or officials monitoring the TV feed then they have surely come through enough examination\nIt also led to another sorry rules mess that made golf look ridiculous. Add this one to the Dustin Johnson fiasco at the men's US Open last year and Anna Nordqvist's rules breach that ruined her chances at the women's equivalent championship a couple of weeks later.\nBut be in no doubt that in this latest controversy only one person made a mistake and that was Thompson. Unwittingly or otherwise, she did not put back her ball in the correct place.\nShe was less than an inch out but she got it wrong and might have given herself an advantage.\nThroughout the due process that followed, the LPGA rules officials acted in accordance with the rules as set out for tournament play.\nUnder current rules, officials have no choice but to investigate a possible rules breach if they are so alerted by a television viewer. And if the tournament is still going on, this applies even if that information comes in on a later day.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSo Thompson was given a two-stroke penalty for incorrectly replacing her ball and two more shots for signing for the wrong score. A total of four shots were added to the tournament leader's card.\nShe only found this out as she moved from the 12th green to the 13th tee a day after the offence was committed.\nAnd this is where the game lets itself look ridiculous. This is where common sense goes out of the window and tournaments are ruined.\nForemost is the fact that golf is a self-policing sport. Golfers and their playing partners are supposed to ensure that the rules are followed and, in so doing, protect the rest of the field from cheats.\nThis is what occurs almost all of the time at every level of the sport.\nAt big events, referees are on hand.

My business which took me ages to build keeps suffering because I am losing customers every day. My loyal customers' behaviours keep changing on a daily basis because of this crisis.\nI had to let all my good employees go, because I can't keep them anymore. I am working over 12 hours a day because I have no employees any more to help me out. It's really tough but there isn't much I can do.\nI am not sure how long I can keep going like this. The only good thing is that I don't have to queue up for cash like most people because I have been putting money away at home for a long time. I knew we were going to have these crises so I made the decision not to save in the bank.\n\"There's simply no cash left\" - Ilia Iatrou, former English teacher\nGreece should continue to say no to the EU demands because the country can't take any more of the ongoing austerity measures. Frankly, the situation is unbearable over here.\nMy mother-in-law queued up for over an hour at the cash point just to be able to withdraw a small amount of money. I haven't tried to go to the cash machine myself, as we don't have much money left. There's simply no cash left in the system.\nSome of us have been forced to now resort to a sort of barter system among ourselves because we have no money left.  We just can't take any more of this, so we have to keep saying no to the EU masters. The EU can't afford to let us fail so we should continue to say no and they will blink and give us a better deal.\n\"This can't carry on\" - Evi Stamou, Orthodontist in Athens\nI run my own practice in Athens and am finding it hard to pay my employees. There is no cash in the system at the moment. My customers can't pay me so this is having an unfair knock on effect on my employees' pay.\nLuckily, I took some money out a while back because I knew we would have this problem. The money is keeping me afloat at the moment but it's running out.\nI queued at several cash points - which all ran out of cash - but eventually I managed to get money out from one of them. This can't carry on and I think we need a deal. Most people want out of the euro but I think it's a bad idea.\n\"We lost half of our employees\" - Susan Benekos, British woman living in Greece for 28 years\nMy family business has suffered tremendously and we lost half of our employees, because of the ongoing crisis. Recently, I couldn't take cash out from the bank.\nThe situation is dire and we are running out of money. We went to the cash point yesterday but couldn't get anything. The problem is many businesses are now accepting only cash and no cards so it's really hard to do anything.\nThis crisis is really destroying our lives. I have friends who have had to go live with their parents because they can't afford to pay their rent.\n\"Everyone is really tense\" - Panos Spiropoulos and Katerina Karneris, run a coffee distribution business in Greece\nThe economy was beginning to pick up again late 2014 but now we seem to have gone backwards after the elections. The uncertainty is damaging our business.

After today, public and legal opinion are more closely aligned. No consensus yet, but narrow majorities in favour of gay couples being allowed to marry and enjoy the same rights as their fellow, straight citizens.\nThe practical implications of today's rulings may be narrow (they only involve 13 states and the District of Columbia), but it was the symbolism of the moment that thrilled the crowd.\nThey know there will be lots of battles ahead. But for the first time, the Supreme Court has attempted to make sense of the rules around gay marriage. For most of those who gathered in the heat outside this great temple of law, today's results suggest the tide of history is with them.\nThe landmark 5-4 rulings prompted celebrations from about 1,000 gay rights advocates gathered outside the Supreme Court in Washington DC and many more nationwide.\nThe legal challenge to Doma was brought by New York resident Edith Windsor, 84.\nShe was handed a tax bill of $363,000 (\u00c2\u00a3236,000) when she inherited the estate of her spouse Thea Speyer - a levy she would not have had to pay if she had been married to a man.\n\"It's an accident of history that put me here,\" Ms Windsor said after the ruling was handed down.\n\"If I had to survive Thea, what a glorious way to do it.

As the state of California refused to defend the ban on gay marriage, the group that sponsored Proposition 8 stepped up to do so.\nOn Wednesday, the US Supreme Court said a private party did not have the right, or \"standing\", to defend the constitutionality of a law, because it could not demonstrate it would suffer injury if the law were to be struck down and same-sex marriages allowed.\n\"We have no authority to decide this case on the merits,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the ruling, which was not split along ideological lines.\nTheir opinion leaves in place a ruling by a lower court, in San Francisco, that struck down Proposition 8.\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown is ordering county officials across the state to comply. The San Francisco appeals court has said it will wait at least 25 days before allowing same-sex marriages to resume in California.\nThe four dissenting Supreme Court justices said they believed they should have addressed the constitutional question of same-sex marriage before them in the Proposition 8 case.\nFurther litigation could lie ahead for the California ban, analysts say.\nPresident Obama called the plaintiffs to congratulate them from Air Force One, his official jet, en route to Africa.\nAbout 18,000 same-sex couples were married in California in the less than five months same-sex marriages were permitted there.\nDoma was signed into law in 1996 by former President Bill Clinton after it was approved in Congress with bipartisan support.\nBut it was subsequently struck down by several lower courts.\nIn 2011, President Obama said that while he would continue to enforce Doma, his administration would not defend it in court. So Republicans from the House of Representatives hired a lawyer to argue in favour of the measure.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, said he was disappointed with Wednesday's ruling.\n\"A robust national debate over marriage will continue in the public square, and it is my hope that states will define marriage as the union between one man and one woman,\" he said.", "output": ["The US Supreme Court has struck down a law denying federal benefits to gay couples and cleared the way for same-sex marriage in California."]}, {"id": "task1290-61154c7d605d4248b8845c8a0e3dee24", "input": "Gavin Egan, 34, was found in Peasholm Park, Scarborough, on 24 February 2016.\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said PC Helen Hardie \"had a case to answer for gross misconduct\".\nThe force said it \"disagreed with the content of their [IPCC] report\".\nMore on this and other North Yorkshire stories\nIn its report, the IPCC said an ambulance had gone to the park after a member of the public had contacted them to say he had pulled a man out out of the lake.\nA paramedic searched the park for about 38 minutes but could not find the missing man, so he called the police.\nPC Hardie attended the scene at about 04:00 GMT.\nThe IPCC report said: \"A four-minute search was carried out before PC Hardie left the area, she did not seek assistance and the incident log was closed soon after.\"\nIt added that the officer concluded the missing man had fled the scene \"despite a paramedic's view that he would be incapable of such action because of freezing temperatures\".\nShe later told an inspector \"there was no evidence a man had been pulled from the lake\".\nMr Egan's body was found at about 11:30 GMT.\nThe IPCC investigator said that in his opinion \"PC Hardie had a case to answer for gross misconduct\".\nIn a statement, North Yorkshire Police said: \"We disagreed with the content of their report and their finding that it amounted to gross misconduct.\n\"We appealed their report and it was subsequently agreed with the IPCC that a misconduct meeting would be held.\n\"This has been carried out and the officer has been issued with a written warning.\"", "output": ["A North Yorkshire Police officer made \"errors\" in the search for a missing man who was later found dead in the lake of a public park, the police watchdog has found."]}, {"id": "task1290-47331adfe1fa4a1db8949fe67a1bb675", "input": "The lines would connect a proposed nuclear power station at Moorside, near Sellafield, to the electricity network.\nNational Grid wants to install large pylons along a corridor from Carlisle to Moorside, then down to the Furness Peninsula and under Morecambe Bay to emerge near Heysham, Lancashire.\nCampaigners are concerned about the impact on the scenery and want cables routed offshore or underground.\nFriends of the Lake District said: \"The pylons are the height of Nelson's Column and would be a dreadful addition to a national park currently engaged in a bid to win World Heritage Status.\n\"This is not a case of preventing infrastructure development going ahead.\n\"There is an opportunity for everybody to benefit if we can persuade government and National Grid that they can achieve the connection of the power station without compromising the natural beauty of the Lake District.\"\nNational Grid said: \"This design will change and evolve in the coming months as we take into account different environmental and land-use issues that will influence where a new connection can be built.\n\"We're working with landowners, councils and specialist groups to get more information about land-use issues that will inform the design of our proposals.\n\"In addition to this ongoing dialogue, we're continuing to engage with local communities and individuals in the coming months.\"\nA series of public events has begun, starting in Egremont, with the final one on 29 October in Heysham.", "output": ["Proposals to build more pylons in Cumbria are going on public show."]}, {"id": "task1290-72a62655e8c9421f9002d4e924e27812", "input": "The 25-year-old will be seen as a replacement for Nigeria's Ahmed Musa who joined English champions Leicester City on Friday.\nTraore has already played in Russia between 2011 and 2014 for Kuban Krasnodar and Anzhi Makhachkala.\nIn January 2014 he joined Monaco, who immediately loaned him to Everton.\nHe scored on his debut for Everton in an FA Cup tie but then picked up a hamstring injury that ruled him out until the final match of the Premier League season.\nLast season he scored three goals in 19 Ligue 1 appearances for Monaco.\nHe was also part of the Ivory Coast squad that won the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon, but only played the final moments of the semi-final win over DR Congo coming on as a substitute.\nCSKA start the new campaign on 23 July  when they face Zenit St. Petersburg in the Super Cup.

But it is equally important to be able to \"think like a scientist\", and Chinese students perform less well in this - although still better than most countries in the west.\nThat is also reflected in student attitudes - for example, American students seem more science-minded than their Chinese counterparts.\nMore stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective, and how to get in touch.\nYou can join the debate at the BBC's Family & Education News Facebook page.\nThey report more frequently than Chinese students that they value scientific approaches to enquiry and adopt a questioning approach.\nThis is important. Education used to be about teaching people facts and theorems, now it's about helping students to develop a reliable compass and the navigation skills to find their own way through an increasingly uncertain, volatile and ambiguous world.\nThese days, we no longer know how things will unfold, sometimes we make mistakes along the way. But it will often be the mistakes and failures, when properly understood, that help learning.\nAn important part of education today is helping students develop positive attitudes towards learning that will endure throughout their lives.\nTwice as many students in the United States as in the four provinces of China, and in most other east Asian countries, for example, aspire to work in a science-related career.\nThat said, many American students will not be able to realise these dreams because they perform poorly in science at school.\nBut while east Asian students score higher in science, they need to develop more positive attitudes towards science.\nPerhaps it has something to do with another finding from the Pisa process - that students in the four Chinese provinces spend close to 57 hours per week studying in school or at home; for students in high-performing Finland it is 36 hours.\nObviously one can't copy and paste school systems wholesale.\nBut Pisa has revealed a surprising number of features shared by the world's most successful school systems.\nFor a start, leaders in east Asian education systems have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education.\nIn east Asia, parents will invest their last resources in educating their children for a brighter future.\nIn much of the western world, citizens have already mortgaged their children's future, as seen in huge mountains of public debt.\nThen there is the belief, widespread throughout east Asia, that all children can succeed.\nThe fact that students in most east Asian countries consistently believe that achievement is mainly a product of hard work, rather than inherited intelligence, suggests how much the social context can make a difference to fostering success.\nSorry, your browser is not supported.\nGoogle\nNowhere does the quality of a school system exceed the quality of its teachers - and the east Asian school systems all pay great attention to how they select and train their staff.\nWhen deciding where to invest, they prioritise the quality of teachers over the size of classes.\nThey provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers. High-performing countries have also moved on from bureaucratic control and accountability to a great sense of professionalism.\nThey encourage their teachers to make innovations in how they teach, to improve their own performance and that of their colleagues, and to pursue professional development.\nThe goal of the past was standardisation and compliance.\nBut today's top-performing countries value inventiveness.\nThey focus on outcomes, shifting from looking inwards to the bureaucracy to looking outwards to the next teacher, the next school, to create networks of innovation. You can see that nowhere better than in Finland or Shanghai.\nPerhaps the most impressive outcome of world-class school systems is that they deliver high quality across the entire school system so that every student benefits from excellent teaching.\nAnd they align policies and practices across all aspects of the system, making them coherent over sustained periods of time, and ensuring that they are consistently implemented. You can see that nowhere better than in Singapore.\nBut the demands on modern education systems will not stop here.\nSchools now need to prepare students to live and work with people from different cultural backgrounds and to appreciate different ideas, perspectives and values. They will live in a world in which people need to trust and collaborate across such differences.\nThose are the reasons why, for the first time, the OECD is putting global competency at the centre of the next Pisa in 2018.\nWe need to enable students to think for themselves and act for others, to educate the next generation who will create jobs, not just seek them, and to prepare our students to confront the unexpected with intelligence and compassion.", "output": ["While the \"American dream\" of social mobility seems nothing more than a dream for many American students, it is emerging as a new reality in much of east Asia."]}, {"id": "task1290-a4a9bd015699435fa6864d7913e56b2b", "input": "The Welsh, needing only a draw to clinch the European title for the first time in five years, all but secured victory by half-time with a 22-0 lead.\nDalton Grant, Lewis Reece, Steve Parry and Rhodri Lloyd scored first-half tries for John Kear's Wales side.\nElliot Kear added a second-half try for the visitors with Callum Mulkeen replying for Ireland late on.\nCourtney Davies kicked 10 points for Wales, whose victory secured them the title at the expense of France, who defeated Scotland 32-18 earlier on Saturday.\nGrant's try edged Wales ahead after Davies kicked a penalty deep into Irish territory.\nAnd after Liam Finn and Elliot Cosgrove had both threatened the Wales line, the visitors broke away for a second try when Reece reacted first after Casey Dunne had dropped a high ball.\nWith Ireland wasting further promising attacking opportunities, they were made to pay with Parry and Lloyd both crossing for the Welsh before the break.\nKear punished more poor Irish defending in the second half as Davies added to his haul of kicked points.\nIreland's sole score came in the 72nd minute as Mulkeen touched down in the corner, but it was scant consolation for the well-beaten home side as Wales celebrated.\nTEAMS\nIreland: Grix, Hargreaves, Mulkeen, Cosgrove, Dunne, Johnston, Finn, Hadden, Beswick, Ambler, Bridge, Hope, Roberts\nSubs: Keyes, Mulhern, Peacock, Gill\nWales: Kear, Williams, Channing, Roets, Drant, Olds, Davies, Walker, Parry, Kopczak, Lloyd, Reece, Joseph\nSubs: Evans, Farrer, Burke, Grace", "output": ["Wales secured the European Championship Rugby League title by beating Ireland 30-4 in Bray on Saturday."]}, {"id": "task1290-c85b688d11804980bd9943cc82b06a3c", "input": "First Minister Arlene Foster said the terms for an independent inquiry were worked out in consultation with the attorney general.\nShe said they were sent to Sinn F\u00e9in who, so far, had not responded.\nHowever, Sinn F\u00e9in's MLA Conor Murphy said they were \"insufficient\".\n\"There has been no agreement with the DUP on the terms of reference of an independent investigation,\" he said.\n\"In order to restore public confidence in the political institutions we need an independent investigation, which is robust, transparent, timeframed and led by a senior judicial figure from outside the jurisdiction and with the power to compel witnesses and subpoena documents.\n\"Arlene Foster should step aside to facilitate that investigation pending a preliminary report.\"\nSet up in November 2012, the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme was an attempt by the Northern Ireland Executive to help to increase consumption of heat from renewable sources.\nIt is approximately \u00a3490m over budget as businesses were receiving more in subsidies than they were paying for renewable fuel and the scheme became heavily oversubscribed.", "output": ["Sinn F\u00e9in has said terms of reference drawn up by the head of the civil service for an investigation into the RHI debacle are short of what is required."]}, {"id": "task1290-29f1ecc82a5c4f1c801dd259364d3939", "input": "Those taking part believe the crime - which often involves blaming fictitious drivers for the offence - is low risk.\nBut police say it is allowing dangerous drivers to avoid being banned and warn those caught could be jailed.\nIn one case a man from Greater Manchester was jailed for seven years for helping around 700 motorists avoid penalty points.\nHe was jailed in January of this year after admitting a string of offences including conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.\nThe case involves one of five alleged speeding point gangs investigated by a specialist unit from Greater Manchester Police in the last two years.\nThames Valley Police are also targeting criminal gangs involved in this type of crime.

I don't feel at all like I'm lying. In the last six months to a year I've realised I've got a fanbase, and I'm bursting to show the album to them.\nOne of those fans recently tweeted you with a picture of their school notebook, where they'd scrawled your name in the margins. What do you make of that?\nThat's crazy, man. That was me - I used to do that! Then suddenly it's about me and my songs. It's a grounding thing to receive.\nWhose name did you doodle?\nWhen I was 13 or 14, it was the classic stuff - The Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd. When you get obsessed with music, those timeless logos always end up getting scribbled over the notebooks. More than any of the homework ever did!\nNever any girls' names?\nOh yeah, you know. But that stuff was always my secret. That was hidden away in the back pages.\nYou come from Hitchin in Hertfordshire. What was that like? Was there a lot of music at home?\nGrowing up in Hitchin was comfortable and easy enough. My parents had some great records - and some not-so-great ones - and that's where I got introduced to Motown and the Stones and Springsteen.\nThen me and my brother would play video games and listen to local radio. I loved pop music as a little kid. Things like the Black Eyed Peas. If it had a catchy chorus I was into it.\nHow did you start playing guitar?\nThere was a guitar that my uncle owned and never learnt to play. He sold it to my dad and when I heard Layla, that was the tune that really grabbed me. I said to my dad, \"wait, there's a guitar, right?\"\nI was a pretty obsessive kid and when I held it in my hands for the first time, I was away.\nThis was a bog-standard electric guitar?\nActually, it was a classic Spanish guitar with nylon strings. It was in bad shape but we got it fixed up.\nDid you teach yourself?\nYeah. The first thing I tried was a CD Rom \"how to play the guitar\" and, oh my God, was it boring. Then I tried lessons, but I didn't have the patience to sit in a class and wait my turn to play one chord.\nAnd suddenly the internet was there. YouTube was a new thing at this point and I could go and explore all this stuff [online guides] really easily.\nWhat was the first song you wrote and played to another person?\nI was playing in a lot of bands at that point, and one of the first songs we played was called It's Raining. It was below rudimentary.\nWe were 13 or 14 and we couldn't go outside that day because\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 well, guess why. We were down, we were blue and I had to express myself. [laughs]\nBut a couple of years later when I went solo, I had a song called Glow which was one of the first ones, playing at pubs, where friends would go, \"play that one\".\nThe story of how you were discovered through a YouTube video sounds too good to be true...\nIt sort of goes like that. There's a few bits in between that are worth including.\nI spent two years playing open mic nights in Brighton and I heard more and more people saying, \"you should give it a go in London.\"\nAnd so I went up to this place called the Abbey Tavern, and I hung around and they gave me three songs to play on stage. This guy walked in during the first song, got himself a drink and sat down in front of me. He had this big camera on his shoulder and suddenly he was filming me from two feet in front of the stage.\nI got chatting to him afterwards and he said, \"basically, I'm a cameraman and I liked your first song so I filmed the second two.\" We swapped details and he put one of the songs up on YouTube.\nA couple of months later a record label in New York found that video somehow, and they gave me a call. I had a manager at this point but they said, \"would you like to fly over to New York and have a chat?\"\nWhat were you doing at this point - working or gigging?\nIn all honesty, I'd had to go back to Hitchin. I did two bar jobs which I started and got fired from in about two months. But I held on to a third.\nIt was the best moment of my life when I said, \"Guys, I'm out. I'm going to New York and they want me to sign a deal\".\nThat cameraman will be after a finder's fee now. Are you still in touch?\nI don't even think the video's on YouTube any more. In fact, I know it's not. But maybe we'll revive it at some point. It almost deserves it.\nYou recorded in Nashville\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 What's it like stepping off the plane there to become part of music history?\nIt was cool but Nashville's a pretty serious place. Intensely tough.\nIn my first week, I stepped out of the studio for a breather. I was thinking, \"this is all a bit nuts. I'm recording my first album and I need to just calm down\" and then Willie Nelson pulled up in the car park!\nHe's not the only country legend you've met... Weren't you accosted by Taylor Swift recently?\nI'd just been around America supporting Hozier and she'd come to see him. At this particular venue, my dressing room was basically the hallway, so we stepped back as she came by. But she stopped and said, \"are you James Bay?\" and I was like, \"well, yeah, but how would you even know?\"\nAnd she sort of went into this whole thing about how she has a regular playlist she listens to, and she's got a couple of my songs on there. So she was dissecting the lyrics to Let It Go in front of me, telling me her favourite lines in the verses.\nIt was bizarre. But she's an enormous pop star, so it's a really amazing bit of appreciation.\nImportant question: Why the hat? Are you, like The Edge, secretly bald \"up top\"?\nThere's no reason! I was living in Brighton, there was a shop called Mad Hatters and I'd seen one or two blues guys wearing these hats. So spur of the moment, I thought I'd give it a go. It hasn't come off my head yet.\nCurrently, the top Google result for James Bay is a body of water in Canada. At what point do you estimate you'll overtake it?\nHaha! There's no point in me chasing that. I think it's got a pretty solid reason to be there.

His speech had become slurred, he shuffled and he was often drowsy.\nParkinson's Syndrome was eventually diagnosed but Ali continued to make public appearances, receiving warm welcomes wherever he travelled.\nHe lit the Olympic cauldron at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and carried the Olympic flag at the opening ceremony for the 2012 Games in London.\n\"I would like to be remembered as a man who won the heavyweight title three times, who was humorous and who treated everyone right.\n\"As a man who never looked down on those who looked up to him...who stood up for his beliefs...who tried to unite all humankind through faith and love.\n\"And if all that's too much, then I guess I'd settle for being remembered only as a great boxer who became a leader and a champion of his people.

Nineteen-year-old Ke Jie described the AI computer as \"perfect, flawless, without any emotions\".\nBut in airports in the UK and elsewhere last weekend tears were also being shed over computers.\nIn this case, though, the primary emotions were frustration and rage over the chaos caused when British Airways' IT system collapsed, leaving thousands of passengers going nowhere and their baggage stuck they knew not where.\nWhat is striking about both these cases is how difficult human beings found it to explain exactly what was happening inside the brains of the computers.\nDeepMind's AlphaGo is largely self-taught - it was shown the basic rules of Go and then it spent time looking at millions of games and playing against itself, coming up with moves that astounded professional players and its creators.\nBA's computers were not so smart. The company says its problems began when there was a power surge at a data centre at Heathrow Airport in London.\nThat shouldn't have been more than a temporary hitch - in fact one expert told me it should not have even set the lights blinking at the data centre - but it seems to have triggered a chain reaction which took out the entire system.\nThat meant the sea of complex data about passengers, baggage and aircraft movements was effectively frozen - and it took 48 hours to unfreeze it and get the airline working again.\nAny major organisation is likely to have both a backup system to switch to when things go wrong and a disaster recovery plan, which should be rehearsed on a regular basis. But in British Airways' case neither appears to have worked as it should.\nThe trade unions blame cost-cutting and the fact that BA outsourced much of its IT operation to India last year.\nThe bosses deny that and say they are now clear what went wrong - but so far, have been unable to give an explanation that seems satisfactory to people with expertise in how data centres and major IT operations work.\nBut what is clear is that ever more areas of our lives are dependent on vast computer systems, often now hosted in data centres owned by companies like Amazon and Microsoft.\nThese systems have become essential to industries from banking to travel to healthcare and they are helping them become more efficient - sometimes by getting much of the work done in countries like India where costs are lower.\nThey are also making life better in all sorts of ways - just think of how time-consuming it used to be to book a flight or apply for a place at university and how much paper was involved.\nBut now we are beginning to find out just how helpless we feel when, for whatever reason, the computers fail.\nIn Britain, doctors whose computers froze during the recent ransomware attack had to turn patients away. In Ukraine, there were power cuts when hackers attacked the electricity system, and five years ago, millions of Royal Bank of Scotland customers were unable to get at their money for days after problems with a software upgrade.\nAlready some people have had enough.

Airlines are not going to scrap the computers and tick passengers off on a paper list before they climb aboard, bank clerks will not be entering transactions in giant ledgers in copperplate writing.\nIn fact, computers will take over more and more functions once restricted to humans, most of them far more useful than a game of Go.

deliberately or unwittingly - to the public at large.\nDr David Grimes, from Oxford University, devised an equation to express this, and then applied it to four famous collusions.\nThe work appears in Plos One journal.\nThe equation developed by Dr Grimes, a post-doctoral physicist at Oxford, relied upon three factors: the number of conspirators involved, the amount of time that has passed, and the intrinsic probability of a conspiracy failing.\nHe then applied his equation to four famous conspiracy theories: The belief that the Moon landing was faked, the belief that climate change is a fraud, the belief that vaccines cause autism, and the belief that pharmaceutical companies have suppressed a cure for cancer.\nDr Grimes's analysis suggests that if these four conspiracies were real, most are very likely to have been revealed as such by now.\nSpecifically, the Moon landing \"hoax\" would have been revealed in 3.7 years, the climate change \"fraud\" in 3.7 to 26.8 years, the vaccine-autism \"conspiracy\" in 3.2 to 34.8 years, and the cancer \"conspiracy\" in 3.2 years.\n\"The mathematical methods used in this paper were broadly similar to the mathematics I have used before in my academic research on radiation physics,\" Dr Grimes said.\nTo derive his equation, Dr Grimes began with the Poisson distribution, a common statistical tool that measures the probability of a particular event occurring over a certain amount of time.\nUsing a handful of assumptions, combined with mathematical deduction, Dr Grimes produced a general, but incomplete, formula.\nSpecifically, he was missing a good estimate for the intrinsic probability of a conspiracy failing. To determine this, Dr Grimes analysed data from three genuine collusions.\nThe first was the surveillance program conducted by the US National Security Agency (NSA), known as PRISM. This programme involved, at most, 36,000 people and was famously revealed by Edward Snowden after about six years.\nThe second was the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, in which the cure for syphilis (penicillin) was purposefully withheld from African-American patients.\nThe experiment may have involved up to 6,700 people, and Dr Peter Buxtun blew the whistle after about 25 years.\nThe third was an FBI scandal in which it was revealed by Dr Frederic Whitehurst that the agency's forensic analysis was unscientific and misleading, resulting in the imprisonment and execution of innocent people.\nDr Grimes estimates that a maximum of 500 people could have been involved and that it took about six years for the scandal to be exposed.\nThe equation he created represents a \"best case scenario\" for conspirators - that is, it optimistically assumes that conspirators are good at keeping secrets and that there are no external investigations at play.\nCrunching the numbers from the three known conspiracies, Dr Grimes calculated that the intrinsic probability of a conspiracy failing is four in one million.\nThough this number is low, the chance that a conspiracy is revealed becomes quite large as time passes and the number of conspirators grows.\nThe Moon landing hoax, for instance, began in 1965 and would have involved about 411,000 Nasa employees. With these parameters, Dr Grimes's equation suggests that the hoax would have been revealed after 3.7 years.\nAdditionally, since the Moon landing hoax is now more than 50 years old, Dr Grimes's equation predicts that, at most, only 251 conspirators could have been involved.\nThus, it is more reasonable to believe that the Moon landing was real.\nProf Monty McGovern, a mathematician at the University of Washington, said the study's methods \"strike me as reasonable and the probabilities computed quite plausible\".\nDr Grimes added: \"While I think it's difficult to impossible to sway those with a conviction...

The keeper was shown the yellow card and Forrester kept his composure to beat Turnbull powerfully to his right from the spot.\nBenitez introduced Demba Ba to try to spare Chelsea's humiliation but it was the much-criticised Torres who did the job for his manager with an instinctive curled finish beyond the reach of Moore.\nBrentford held on but survived one huge stoppage time scare when Harlee Dean handled Mata's chip into the area but referee Jon Moss ignored Chelsea's frantic appeals.\nFull Time   The referee blows for the end of the match.\nClayton Donaldson produces a right-footed shot from close range that goes over the bar.\nFree kick awarded for an unfair challenge on Sam Saunders by Ashley Cole.

Helmut!\" marked a turning point. In that cold night, in front of the Frauenkirche, an emotional bond was forged between Mr Kohl and East Germans that sped the country towards unification.\nPolitics is all about presence, and Mr Kohl, a big man, was an expert in corporeal politics.\nHe always sought to draw people near, because then he was at his best. He spent hours cajoling the party ranks on the phone, and he enjoyed serving his beloved Saumagen - or stuffed pig's stomach - to foreign dignitaries, whether they liked it or not.\nHe held French leader Francois Mitterrand's hand over graves at the World War One battlefield of Verdun.\nIn the photographs the French president will forever look conspicuously small next to the German chancellor.\nIt was a form of physical politics that worked well with men like then US President Bill Clinton or Russia's Boris Yeltsin, who invited Mr Kohl to join him in the sauna. Not surprisingly, it did not sit well with then UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.\nTo a Germany that had ceased to be politically ambitious, Helmut Kohl was, for the longest time, the perfect chancellor. He looked like a man in control, while managing to make the power in his hands seem harmless.\nHe talked reforms, without bothering the country with too many of them.\nHis aura was that of a trustworthy stalwart, and his success helped him shrug off the elites' view of him as a provincial buffoon. It embittered him nevertheless.\nHelmut Kohl defined Germany's politics for a generation through the sheer force of his persona and his political genius.\nYet after he was forced out of office in 1998, the country rarely looked back.\nThe Christian Democrats stripped him of the party's honorary chairmanship because of his role in a party slush fund scandal and the difficulties of the euro - devised by Mr Kohl as Germany's ultimate commitment to European integration.\nThese setbacks have overshadowed what he considered his greatest achievement.\nHis European Union, like much of his politics, was not really meant to work without him. And it didn't. Soon the global threats of terror and financial crises made him look to many Germans like a man from a different era.\nMoreover, a debilitating fall in 2008 had robbed Mr Kohl of the chance to defend his political legacy.\nHe remained silent too when his sons wrote bestsellers disassociating themselves from their bullying father.\nAs his first wife Hannelore - with whom he had once authored a cookbook - had killed herself, he was now looked after by his much younger second wife in his old bungalow home in Oggersheim, in the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate.\nIn the end, Mr Kohl - whose politics were formed so much around relationships - had run out of friends and foes alike.\nIn 2014 Helmut Kohl visited the Frankfurt Book Fair once more to present a book on his own account of the events of 1989-90.\nDespite being close to incoherent, he spoke a few words.\nSeeing their once mighty chancellor reduced to a frail figure in a wheelchair made most Germans feel uncomfortable.\nA Dutch journalist witnessing the scene saw something else: a historical figure. \"How moving,\" he said.", "output": ["Now that Helmut Kohl has died, the German people and their longest-serving chancellor will never be able to make their peace."]}, {"id": "task1290-b3d32bb00e7d47e4a886eee99758d53a", "input": "A failure to agree a deal would have triggered spending cuts and tax increases worth $600bn (\u00c2\u00a3370bn).\nThere had been fears that the measures would have derailed economic recovery in the world's biggest economy and perhaps even push it into a recession.\nHong Kong shares gained 2.9% and South Korea's Kospi added 1.7%.\nSingapore's Straits Times index gained by 1.3%.

\"devo-max\" settlement, the chancellor has signed a deal with local civic leaders to offer their city-region a greater degree of self-government.\nWestminster has a significant problem with Scotland, which is currently the subject of a commission (to report at the end of December) considering the logistics of handing additional powers to Edinburgh.\nThe more Scottish parliamentarians control their own taxes, borrowing, public spending and welfare, the less fair it appears that England has no equivalent powers.\nWales, like Scotland, is on the road to additional tax devolution.\nEngland is a highly centralised country: 95% of all taxes are set by the chancellor, with the \"local\" 5%, council tax being effectively capped by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles.\nCouncils have very limited freedom over local resources.\nCities and counties in England must bid to central government for a share of the public expenditure financed by tax paid by their own residents.\nThis picture is not new, things were the same under Labour.\nFollowing devolution to Scotland and Wales in 1999, the Labour government offered a weak version of regional government to England.\nThe North East famously rejected the chance to have a regional assembly in 2004, largely on the grounds it had virtually no powers.\nSubsequently, cities and city-regions have come forward with proposals for greater local autonomy.\nGreater Manchester started the process of developing a \"city-region\" in 2004.\nThe 10 metropolitan districts in the wider Manchester metropolitan area, which had been within a \"metropolitan county\" until it was abolished by the Conservative government in 1986, began to build up their capacity to govern jointly.\nIn particular, they developed an economic plan that included proposals to concentrate economic activity in some locations and improve transport links so people could access new jobs created in the city centre and close to the airport.\nTowards the end of the last government, councils were given new powers to create \"combined authorities\", which made it possible for Greater Manchester and other groups of authorities to create formal new structures that could provide a robust basis for more effective joint action.\nTransport, fire and emergencies and economic planning were among the functions brought together by the GM authorities and, increasingly, other city-regional groupings.\nThe present government has thrown its support behind the wider use of joint-working by councils.\nAll regional government bodies, including development agencies, were abolished after the coalition took office, allowing new sub-national groupings to emerge.\nMinisters encouraged \"local enterprise partnerships\" (LEPs) to be formed by groups of authorities and local businesses.\nThese LEPs are able to bid for central grants to encourage local economic activity.\nIt is from this background the deal between Greater Manchester and Chancellor George Osborne emerged.\nThere will be a GM-wide elected mayor, plus greater powers over transport, policing and skills training.\nNew investment in transport has also been promised.\nOther big cities, notably Leeds/West Yorkshire and Sheffield/South Yorkshire are expected be given their own package of powers, though the government wants them to adopt a \"metro mayor\" in exchange for greater freedom and resources.\nThe North East, involving Newcastle, Gateshead and a mixture of urban and rural councils, has concluded a deal to extend its control over bus services.\nMost city-regions want the powers enjoyed by Transport for London, the capital's powerful rail, bus, tram and taxi agency.\nOther cities and city-regions will not want to be omitted from this tentative step towards devolution in England.\nBirmingham and the West Midlands, in particular, have been largely sidelined in the debate about the future governance of northern cities.\nBirmingham and its neighbours are now taking steps towards creating their own combined authority so as to qualify for additional powers.\nIn the East Midlands, the geography of Nottingham, Leicester and their respective counties makes progress towards a devolutionary offer more complex than elsewhere.\nDerbyshire is setting up a county-based joint authority, to include Derby.\nIn Bristol, it has thus-far proved difficult for the city and its surrounding councils to create a city-regional entity.\nFor parts of England that are not city-regions, major cities or London, there is an increasing sense they are being cut off from the devolutionary action.\nPlaces such as North Yorkshire or the Thames Valley, are significant economic entities in their own right.\nCornwall has a separate cultural status and could claim separate government arrangements.\nOver time, it will be necessary for the government to offer devolution to smaller cities and rural counties - 10 authorities in south-east Wales are also considering a large combined authority.\nFor the time being, however, it is the great cities of England that are making the most pressing demands for more autonomy.\nIf this or the next government decides that the \"English question\" is to be answered by transferring power from central to local government, it is likely that Greater Manchester, Leeds/West Yorkshire and Sheffield/South Yorkshire will be the vehicles to achieve such change.\nThe main obstacle to reform is Whitehall.\nThe Treasury feels the need to control every pound of public expenditure while the health and education departments are perennially involved in top-down reform of their services.\nMinisters and civil servants do not want to cede powers to cities, city-regions, counties or anyone else.\nThe Cabinet Office and the Department for Communities and Local Government are broadly pro-localism, but they rarely win major battles against bigger battalions such as the Treasury.\nSo what might English government look like by 2020?\nIt is unlikely there will be an English parliament, as such an institution would seriously unbalance the union of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nMajor metropolitan areas, including the built-up districts around London, Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Newcastle and Sheffield will almost certainly have been given enhanced service responsibilities.\nFree-standing smaller cities and counties (probably combined with their districts and smaller unitary councils) may still be waiting their devolutionary package.\nA far more radical outcome might, of course, be possible if there were a political earthquake at Westminster which changed the dynamics of British government.", "output": ["Will Greater Manchester (GM) be the first part of England to benefit from a degree of

But here was probably its biggest story, garnering the most global attention, that I was missing entirely as I spend two weeks working in London. I've had to watch the events of his death unfold, and my fellow Singaporeans grieving from afar.\nBut my anguish isn't just professional, it is also personal. As a Singaporean growing up in the 1970s and 80s under Lee Kuan Yew, the influence he had on my life and the lives of many millions of Singaporeans has been immense. The story has been told a million times, how with a tight grip on power, he and his team took a small third world country with limited natural resources and turned it one of the world's wealthiest countries per capita in a generation.\nBut what was it like growing up as that transformation took place?\nEven as children, we were aware of the constant change, not just externally, with the nation's skyline, its factories and rivers, but also internally.  Campaigns spearheaded by Mr Lee's government sought to micromanage our behaviour. From courtesy to anti-spitting campaigns, Singaporeans were taught from a young age how to be compliant.\nWhen we were older, we were told how many children we should have and even whom to marry. As graduates, you were encouraged to marry someone with the same level of education, to make real Mr Lee's vision of social engineering and becoming a nation producing smarter babies.\nWatching the thousands throng the streets - first to show their respects to his coffin at Parliament House and then to watch his funeral motorcade go by in a tropical downpour - made me think at first that here at work was the same thing: compliance, from a nation so accustomed to doing as he said. The alternative often meant being sued, or thrown into detention without trial. Most Singaporeans traded up personal freedoms for economic success.\nBut here at work was something more. Tears and emotions were high, not just in Singapore but for the many Singaporeans living overseas. My extended family, many of whom have emigrated to the US and Canada, spent days debating his legacy on our family group on WhatsApp. If he was having that impact on them, years after they left their country, imagine what sort of influence his death still wielded on many millions more.\nIt's hard to put in words the effect he had. For many, including myself, it was a love-hate relationship. Love for the immense transformation his governance brought to Singapore. How it's now admired as a nation to be emulated by giants such as India, which has Singapore building a new city for it, and China, which had President Xi Jinping dispatching generals to live there to study its model of governance. Being Singaporean makes me hold my orange-red passport proud at immigration lines worldwide.\nBut hate for the way his executed the transformation, depriving many of free speech, a two-party state, their native Chinese dialects and, if you were a man, the freedom to wear your hair long, get out of military conscription and love a member of the same sex. And then there's the ban on chewing gum that many foreigners seem to delight in pointing out.\nMr Lee's influence spanned well over the 31 years that he actually governed. As a senior minister and then \"minister mentor\" - titles he took after standing down as prime minister in 1990 - his counsel was regularly sought by Singapore's next generation of leaders, including the current leader, his son, Lee Hsien Loong.\nSuch a cult of personality has been built around Lee Kuan Yew's intelligence and vision that continuing on as a successful nation almost seems impossible without him.\nIt's made me nervous about the Singapore I shall find when I return, stepping through the comfortable gates of Changi Airport in a little over a week's time.

It's even got an instrument on it that is named after her.\nNew Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever despatched from Earth.\nAnd on Tuesday, after nine-and-a-half years of travel at immense speed, it will finally reach the diminutive world, some 4.7 billion km away.\nA few things have changed in the intervening years.\nThe first surely everyone now knows: Pluto is no longer regarded as a main planet and has been re-categorised as a \"dwarf planet\".\nThe second feeds into the first, and that is the recognition of just how numerous planetary bodies of all sizes are, not just within our Solar System, but around all the stars we see \"beyond China\".\nWho'd have thought that some of these stars would have super-Earths and colossal Jupiters?\nThe arguments still rage over whether Pluto should be included in the planetary mnemonics that children learn in school.\nBut in many ways this is a distraction - and a distraction from something that is actually more interesting and really quite exciting.\nThink about it for a moment: If the \"classical nine\" planets were all there were, then Tuesday would represent an ending. It would be the completion of a quest to map out our Solar System.\nAs it is, we now like to think of the reconnaissance of Pluto as just the start of something, as the beginning of the exploration of the \"third zone\".\nIf the first and second zones encompass the rocky inner planets like Earth and the outer gas giants like Saturn, then this third sector covers all the smaller bodies like Pluto that orbit billions of km from the Sun. And they are legion.\nThis third zone, known as the Kuiper Belt, probably contains hundreds of thousands of objects 100km and more across. Pluto, at about 2,300km wide, just happens to be the current \"King of Kuiper Belt\".\n\"Pluto is the biggest and brightest, and, as far as we know, it's the most interesting of this third class of planets,\" Alan Stern, the principal investigator on New Horizons, told BBC Newsnight.\n\"It was a wonderful discovery that our Solar System has this extra class and that - surprise, surprise - it is the most populous class. It's amazing: we had a completely upside-down view until the 1990s.\"\nAnd not just in our Solar System. It is very probable that the dwarf planets are the most abundant type of planet in the Milky Way as a whole.\nAnd remember, they will not all be dull balls of ice and rock.\nAs we're seeing on the approach to Pluto, many will have active processes shaping their surfaces. Some, just like Pluto, will even have atmospheres with evolving climates.\nNew Horizons should be thought of then as a sentinel.\nIt's the first mission designed to go and investigate this third domain.\nAfter passing Pluto, it will be directed to a second Kuiper Belt object, which it will reach in another four years or so.\nMore missions will no doubt follow. Our problem currently is knowing where to direct them.\nPresent telescopes struggle to see the third zone, to pick out the candidates most worthy of a spacecraft encounter.\nBut this is all about to change.  We're now building a new generation of monster observatories whose primary mirrors will be 30-40m across.  These new telescopes will have the sensitivity and the resolution to open up the Kuiper Belt to a new era of study.\nIf you run the models, based on our best understanding, you would have expected a thousand or so Plutos to have been around in the early days of the Solar System, more than four billion years ago.  But then we think there was a big re-organisation, and many of these objects would either have been destroyed in collisions, or scattered by close encounters with their own kind and the bigger planets.\nSome will still be there, albeit perhaps further away than the Kuiper Belt, in an even more distant realm called the Oort Cloud.\n\"If these models are correct, we should expect to find dramatically more small planets, and possibly some large planets that were also scattered out there - Earth-sized and Mars-sized,\" says Prof Stern.\nJust a final aside on Pluto's demotion from \"full\" planet status.\nI got the chance the other day to talk about New Horizons with the famous radio astronomer Jocelyn Bell Burnell. It was she who facilitated the technical meeting a few months after the probe's launch in 2006 that downgraded Pluto.\nShe could not be more excited about the next few days.\n\"I think New Horizons has come out of it very well,\" she told BBC Newsnight.\n\"By going to visit Pluto and one or two other objects in the Kuiper Belt, it is going to a zone that hasn't previously been explored. And I think it's brilliant.\n\"Being able to send spacecraft out that far is going to lead to a lot of new information and, hopefully, new understanding.\"\nYou can watch a preview of the New Horizons flyby on Monday on BBC Two's Newsnight programme at 22:30 BST.

Supporters, including many lay Catholics, dispute this.\nThe church itself is exempted from the rule, but many Catholic institutions, including hospitals, schools and charities, are not automatically exempted and must apply for one.\nAfter the initial row erupted in January, President Barack Obama offered a compromise. Religious institutions would not have to provide the extended coverage, but the insurance companies would pay for it.\nAt first that seemed to meet with some approval from the US Catholic Bishops Conference, as well as from Notre Dame University, but that is no longer the case.\nSome Catholic bodies self-insure so they would not be one step removed from covering something they say violates their religious conscience.\nAnd the row has intensified as it has evolved into one about \"religious liberty\".\nCardinal Timothy Dolan, the Archbishop of New York, has led the charge by saying Catholic organisations will have to prove themselves Catholic enough in order to qualify for an exemption from the mandate.\n\"The exemption given to the churches is so strangling and is so narrow. And it's also presumptuous in that a bureau of the federal government is attempting to define for the church the extent of its ministry.\"\nIt is, for opponents, a violation of the First Amendment, which protects religion from state interference.\nThe US Catholic Bishops Conference has called on Catholics to join in 14 days of prayer and public action to defend religious liberty, as they put it, from 21 June to 4 July.\nBut some Catholic bodies have indicated they can work with Mr Obama's compromise.

immigration from the European Union has come to the fore.\nThe right of 508 million citizens to move freely across the 28-member bloc is one of its fundamental principles.\nToday, there are about three million people from other EU countries living in the UK, and an estimated 1.2 million British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.\nLike it or not, immigration will be a part of some voters' decisions.\nWhen I started going to different parts of the UK to explore the impact of immigration - and attitudes to it - I was struck by the care with which most people addressed the arguments.\nImmigration's being talked about much more than usual in the run-up to the referendum, but I could see how concerned people were to come across in a balanced way.\nPerhaps it's because they were talking to someone whose skin colour and name indicate a foreign heritage, but I think it also tells us something about the fundamental decency of British society.\nBut in the past decade, there has been profound change to the make-up of that society.\nThe EU referendum:\nThe key moment was the enlargement of the European Union, to bring in many eastern European countries in 2004. With wages there much lower than in Western Europe, there was an immediate and obvious incentive to move from the poorer parts of the expanded EU to the richer ones.\nLast year, net migration from the EU - the difference between the numbers of people coming into and leaving Britain - reached 184,000.\nFor me, the stories of two women I met in the course of making a film illustrate the debate. They are both British, both mothers, both living in the east of England but will be voting opposite ways in the referendum.\nIn both cases the simple question they'll be asked on their polling card has a much greater significance - for one, linking into how she believes Britain should be providing better for its citizens - and for the other, how she sees the EU as a symbol of freedom.\nThe first view comes from the Leave voter - Sonia Chowles, 30, from Clacton, the one constituency to have returned a UKIP MP at the last election. From being a thriving Essex seaside resort in the 1960s, it has suffered over the years and unemployment is now above the national average.\nSonia is employed - in a local taxi firm - but life is far from easy. She has two young children and her husband is disabled. She hopes for a council house better-suited to his needs but tells me there is a 15-year wait.\nClacton is home to relatively few people born outside the UK, but Sonia feels its services cannot cope.\n\"I don't think it's a case of no more immigrants - it's a case of no more anybody. English, Scottish, Welsh, from the EU, from America - we just can't physically take any more people into this town.\"\nThe referendum has energised and galvanised Sonia to enter political debate - she's joining UKIP, with a view to standing for election. She's also done her research on the costs of the EU and carefully uses a net figure when talking about Britain's contribution, rather than the gross figure, which has been criticised as misleading.\nOn 23 June, Sonia and her husband will be voting to leave the EU, and she tells me nearly everyone else she knows will be doing the same.\nIf I brought her face-to-face with the other woman on my mind, Grazyna Lisowska-Troc, I know they would have a perfectly civilised debate and probably be able to see things from each other's perspective.\nGrazyna is 43 and lives in Peterborough, having arrived from Warsaw with her husband Tomasz and newborn daughter Agata in 2004. All three are now British citizens.\nGrazyna and Tomasz both work as auditors and their daughter, now 11, goes to a sought-after local school. Part of what they love about the UK is its diversity - Agata is exposed to different cultures and religions in a way that her parents, growing up in Poland, never were.\nAnd for them, the EU also represents an ideal. Grazyna's own mother was deported by the Soviets from eastern Poland to Central Asia after World War Two, and she does not take life in a time of peace and stability for granted. On 23 June, she'll be voting Remain.\nGrazyna is also keen to emphasise what migrants like her give back to the UK: \"Just look at my P60,\" she tells me with a twinkle in her eye, a reference to her personal contribution to the Treasury's coffers.\nHMRC tax figures for 2013-14 support her argument, showing that migrants put in \u00a32.5bn more than they took out in benefits. But that does little to address the frustration of citizens in areas where public services are visibly under pressure.\nIn Grazyna's own city, Peterborough, local GP Dr Emma Tiffin told me of the health problems that arise from the conditions in which many low-paid migrants live.\n\"We have a large number in houses of multiple occupancy - several families in one house, sometimes a family in one room.\n\"There are houses that are very damp, and that causes a high risk of respiratory infections.\"\nDr Tiffin sees migration as an added pressure and a challenge to the service she can offer in her part of inner-city Peterborough.\nBut nationally the picture is more complex. Most migrants are young, so they use the NHS less than the average. For the same reason, they have more children, which impacts on maternity services. And both the NHS and the care sector have high numbers of migrants working within them.\nThis issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.\nWith the UK's population projected to grow by more than four million in the next decade - half of the increase thanks to immigration - this is no longer a conversation politicians can dodge.\nIt may in the end be a question of competing priorities and trade-offs.\nTake one of the most popular words in political discourse - \"aspiration\".\nEvery politician would agree that raising aspirations and improving social mobility is a good thing. But as countries get richer and their citizens more skilled, it's often immigrants who fill the gaps.\nIn what numbers, and to what extent, is the question Britain has to weigh up and, because of the EU's freedom of movement rules, the referendum will be an opportunity for some voters to do just that.\nThe choices both Grazyna and Sonia will make will be rooted in their own experience and in the belief that they are doing what is best for their children. And, on 24 June, we will know whether it was Leave or Remain that proved more persuasive for their fellow citizens.\nBritain & Europe: The Immigration Question is on BBC Two at 21:00 BST on Tuesday 14 June, BBC World News at 04:00 GMT and 15:00 GMT on Saturday 18 June and 09:00 GMT and 21:00 GMT on Sunday 19 June and will be available later via BBC iPlayer.", "output": ["How can it be that one of the biggest concerns for British voters is something that British politicians often find difficult to talk about, let alone address?"]}, {"id": "task1290-9ac7858b5ab4485583bd2c86fab33acd", "input": "But the retired butcher died of cancer at the age of 71 more than a year ago.\nSo when the station finally opened in the Derbyshire town, his grandson decided to take his ashes on board the train instead.\n\"He got his wish,\" said James Clifton. \"He would have loved it.\"\nMr Hardy lived in Ilkeston all his life, running a local butchers' shop for more than 30 years, and thought it \"sad\" that having once had three railway stations the town had been left with none.\nIlkeston had no train service for half a century, making it one of the largest UK towns without a railway station.\nWhile plans for the new station were approved in 2013, the project was delayed by a variety of problems, including the discovery of protected newts.\n\"He was really happy when they started to develop plans for the new station,\" said Mr Clifton's husband, Michael Banton.\n\"He said: 'I'm going to be one of the first on that train.'

She comes from a golfing family and dabbled at an early age but it's only in the last two years that she has taken the sport seriously, cutting her handicap from 26 to 12 at Ladybank Golf Club and learning some valuable lessons along the way.\nHere, Hannah - who is a member of Sport Scotland's Young People's Sport Panel - explains how focusing on golf has altered her outlook on life...\nHannah: Golf didn't come naturally to me. I could pick up the basics of many other sports relatively quickly but golf had me stumped.\nHowever, I managed to transform this frustration into determination. I realised I had to focus on the happiness I felt when I had hit a good shot, to outweigh my sheer fury at the bad ones.\nFrom there I was hooked but now I needed to knuckle down and work hard, which is why I see golf as such a valuable learning opportunity. I realised the only way to get what you want out of life is through hard work and persistence.\nHowever, as crucial as practising my swing and my putting was to my improvement, I was overlooking a major aspect of golfing success - the need for mental strength.\nI began reading sports psychology books and researching authors who had worked with some of the best golfers but what I didn't realise was the core values it would enable me to transfer to my everyday life.\nHere are three of the key learnings I believe can help in all areas of life, sport, school or any other challenge:\n1. Stay in the present\nIn golf this means not allowing your mind to wander during your round. But I think this is crucial in life - it helps you to understand the importance of focusing on what is in front of you and not worrying too much about the future.\nIf you are thinking about the future, it means there is a lack of detail and attention on what you are currently doing.\n2. Commit to a pre-shot routine\nIn golf this means having a regimented routine you can carry out in order to apply the same level of commitment to each shot. I believe if you behave in a consistent manner, apply your beliefs and morals to all you do, you are more likely to reap reliable results.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n3. Don't label yourself\nIf you label yourself, say as someone who always shoots 80, then that is what you will do - because you become what you say you are. In life, too, as soon as you categorise yourself in a negative way it affects who you believe you can become, limiting your growth and chances of success.\nEven if you have no desire to take up golf, never overlook the lessons sport can teach you. They can help you realise things about yourself that you would never discover in a classroom.\nHopefully the above tips will help you as much as they've helped me, and remember - education is everywhere!\nFor more information on how to get into golf, check out our Get Inspired guide.", "output": ["Many sports lend themselves to comparison with the ups and down of life in general, but golf is a particularly fertile ground for this kind of parallel."]}, {"id": "task1290-5b8d851c0b424be3b98f4add613f4531", "input": "The Electoral Office had dropped Howard Primary School as a polling station.\nIt followed claims that loyalist flag protestors prevented some people from voting there at last year's local government and European elections.\nHowever, the Electoral Commission intervened and said the polling station should be reinstated, as the proper consultation process was not followed.\nThis meant that last month a further consultation period was announced, which included hearing views from voters, politicians, political parties and the police.\nThe decision that will determine whether polling will take place there in next month's general election is expected to be announced later on Monday.\nIn the last general election in 2010, Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in's Michelle Gildernew took the Fermanagh and South Tyrone seat by four votes, following three recounts.", "output": ["An announcement is expected later on the future of a polling station at Moygashel in County Tyrone."]}, {"id": "task1290-53d5c5e9dfed43e7a4c2b8dc02e78785", "input": "The vote will take place on 2 March 2017.\nIn Northern Ireland the government must be shared between two different political parties.

But the company signalled that new investment commitments may be low, particularly in tankers and drilling.\nMaersk Oil has been operating in the UK central North Sea sector for 11 years, and is a partner in some of the biggest developments during that time, including the Golden Eagle.\nFrom a small country perspective, Maersk looks like a giant. So it is uncomfortable for Denmark that the giant has been weakened in both legs.\nShipping has been hit by sharp reductions in rates for containers - a notoriously volatile market. That is partly due to a downturn in trade, and also to the extra tonnage added to the world container fleet.\nHanjin Shipping, the seventh-biggest in container transport and based in South Korea, recently filed for bankruptcy. It is struggling to find the finance to offload cargo from its ships, worth several billion pounds.\nMaersk's energy business faces problems which are at least as deep as shipping, due to the fall in the price of oil. The company's strategic review speaks of finding \"solutions\" including joint ventures, mergers or spinning off companies for separate listing. The vagueness of the plan makes it look like an intention to exit as much of that sector as possible, and shipping is clearly the priority.\nThe North Sea presence may be one part of the energy division that is retained, as the technology involved is an area of expertise. That's unless a buyer can be found.\nBreaking up the 112-year-old conglomerate is a reversal of the strategy under which Maersk Line grew to have a fleet of 590 ships, plus 500 smaller service ships. It was guided by its chairman Maersk McKinney Moller, who remained active in the company until his death four years ago, aged 98.\nIt is operator of the Culzean gas field development, which is one of the biggest in UK waters for 25 years. It is expected to meet 5% of Britain's gas demand after it comes on-stream, scheduled for 2019.\nIts other production is from Denmark, Qatar, Kazakhstan, the US Gulf of Mexico and Algeria. Exploration and development activities are also under way in Angola, Kenya, Ethiopia, Greenland, Brazil, Kurdistan, and the huge Johan Sverdrup field being developed in the Norwegian North Sea.\nMichael Pram Rasmussen, the chairman, said in a statement: \"Separating our transport and logistics businesses and our oil and oil related businesses...will enable both to focus on their respective markets. Both face very different underlying fundamentals and competitive environments.\"\nThe oil, drilling, offshore services and tanker divisions face moves towards joint ventures, sales and stock market floats over the next two years. Profits in that division have recently come in well below expectations.\nThe company's strategy states: \"Maersk Oil will adjust its current strategy to focus its portfolio in fewer geographies to gain scale in basins, particularly in the North Sea, where it can leverage its strong capabilities within subsurface modelling, well technology and efficient operations. Maersk Oil will aim to strengthen its portfolio through acquisitions or mergers.\n\"Further, Maersk Oil will mature existing key development projects, while keeping exploration activities and expenses at a low level. While the strategic focus will be reflected in a disciplined capital allocation, investments in strategic projects already sanctioned or under development will continue as planned.\n\"Maersk Drilling, Maersk Supply Services, and Maersk Tankers will continue to optimise their market position and operation with the existing fleet and order book.

The statistic of 30 Premier League appearances this season and no goals is damning.\nVerdict: Could be in danger if the right offer comes in. Now 29 and will not get any better.\nDid you know? Navas has made a team-high seven assists this season in the league.\nAge: 31; Signed: 2010 (\u00a324m); Appearances: 24; Goals: 8\nThe big dilemma - the driving force behind City's years of success but has looked laboured, jaded and occasionally disconnected this season. He has looked a shadow of his former self.\nHe has also failed to impose himself when City have needed him. No-one should ever under-estimate what he has done for City but the time comes for everyone and it may have come for Toure.\nVerdict: If a club such as Inter Milan offer a decent deal, time to sell and move on.\nDid you know? Toure has made more touches (2,456) than any other player in the squad this season, ranking fifth league-wide in this category.\nAge: 29; Signed: 2010 (\u00a326m); Appearances: 26; Goals: 11\nMaybe not quite touched the previous heights this season but still a magical footballer capable of making decisive contributions. A player and personality who has graced the Premier League and will continue to do so.\nVerdict: Staying.\nDid you know? Silva has created 77 goalscoring chances for his team-mates this year, the most at City and only Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas have created more in the entire league.\nAge: 26; Signed: 2011 (\u00a338m); Appearances: 27; Goals: 19\nWorld-class, despite a failure to produce his very best after picking up a knee injury in December - something that hit City hard.\nAguero is as close to a guarantee of Premier League goals as you can get and is crucial to everything City want to achieve.\nVerdict: Indispensable. Irreplaceable.\nDid you know? Aguero has attempted more shots (93) than any other player in the league this season.\nAge: 26; Signed: 2015 (\u00a328m); Appearances: 5; Goals: 1\nBrought from Swansea City to give Manchester City extra cutting edge but has made a slow start then picked up an injury. He has, however, proved his Premier League pedigree and City will expect to see his best next season.\nVerdict: Part of the future.\nDid you know? Bony has played just 219 minutes for City this season, making just two starts and not completing 90 minutes once.\nAge: 29; Signed: 2011 (\u00a327m); Appearances: 21; Goals: 4\nMiserable season for the Bosnian whose goals did so much to bring the title to Manchester City - just four in 21 Premier League games reflects his poor form.\nThe decision to bring in Bony for \u00a325m from Swansea City was perhaps an admission of Dzeko's decline and reduced impact. Evidence suggests City have had his best years.\nVerdict: May just have outlived his usefulness at the Etihad.\nDid you know? Dzeko has just four goals so far this season in 21 appearances, his last three seasons saw him score 16, 14 and 14 goals respectively.\nAge: 25; Signed: 2013 (\u00a322m); Appearances: 17; Goals: 5\nHe is a gifted Montenegrin who has shown quality in flashes but nowhere near often enough.

He would add pace to City's attack and be a creative force.\nComplication: Despite an increasingly messy and public contract impasse, Liverpool insist he will not be sold this summer.\nAnd when Liverpool owner John W Henry said the same with Luis Suarez in 2013, he was true to his word.\nThe sort of signing that would tell the football world Manchester City mean business. For all his supposed struggles at the Bernabeu, a world-class talent.\nComplication - Real insist he will not be sold and Bale has expressed no wish to leave but things change by the hour at the Bernabeu.\nAlso Bale has constantly been linked with Manchester United should he return to the Premier League.

At least two others are already under construction.\nChinese warship design tends to evolve gradually. Here the PLAN 052D is no exception - it bears clear links to its predecessor, the 052C.\nBut it differs in important respects to the extent that many analysts believe what we are seeing is the first of what could be a series of new Chinese warships that could form the backbone of its fleet.\nProf James Holmes, a China-watcher at the US Naval War College, says the chief significance of the new vessel \"is that China appears to have settled on a design for a top-of-the-line guided-missile destroyer after a lengthy period of 'fleet experimentation' - a gestation period, if you will\".\n\"The PLA Navy has made a habit of building a couple of copies of each design, taking them to sea, identifying their faults and strengths, and incorporating the lessons learned into future designs,\" he says.\n\"Evidently Beijing is satisfied it has learned enough to go into mass production, if indeed,\" as he believes, \"10 hulls are under construction.\"\n\"One hopes it will finally settle the debate about the direction and permanence of Chinese naval power,\" he adds.\nThere are strong indications, he argues, that the Chinese \"believe they've found their standard surface combatant.\"\nThis new destroyer could be a central element of Beijing's new blue-water navy.\nAnother observer of Chinese naval affairs is Feng Cao. It was his blogging that first alerted Western defence circles to the new warship design.\nHe has been making a careful study of Chinese defence publications and displays at trade exhibitions for several years, piecing together clues to the way in which China's naval power is developing.\nHe is not so sure that the 052D is itself the new vessel. But he explained that it was an important step towards what the Chinese Navy has wanted for years; a capable guided-missile destroyer somewhere in size between the US Navy's Arleigh Burke and Ticonderoga classes.\n\"In a couple of years, we will see a whole new class of surface warship that uses a new propulsion system,\" he says.\n\"From the 052C to the 052D, the hull itself really didn't change that much other than moving a couple of things around to fit the new weapon systems and decreasing the radar signature of the ship a little bit. The propulsion system is basically still the same.\"\n\"What's really changed is the weapons system,\" he says. \"The first obvious change are the new larger and flat multi-functional radar panels and the new vertical launch system (VLS).\n\"They are no longer using the VLS we saw on 052C, but rather a new type of universal VLS that can support different types of missiles to strike at both air and sea targets as well as against shore installations.\"\nIn his view the 052D is \"a stepping stone to that new series of surface warship they want to get to. 052D basically uses an existing proven hull and propulsion system to test out these new weapon systems.\"\n\"When the new series of ships come along,\" he says, \"they will have less risks to worry about, because much of the weapon systems will already have their issues worked out using the 052D.\"\nJames Holmes stresses the significant leap in capability that these new vessels will bring. The United States' equivalent ships are fitted with the so-called Aegis radar and battle-management system.\nIf, as he believes, this is an Aegis equivalent ship and there are plans to build 10 of them, then he says \"this will give China's navy an air-defence capability on par with that of any navy in the region, and far more hulls than any other Asian fleet.\"\n\"Japan and South Korea have Aegis vessels, but only six and three, respectively,\" he says.\nProf Holmes says the new Chinese vessel's closest US counterpart is probably the US Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, its first Aegis ships.\nThough he notes that the new Chinese destroyer \"carries only two-thirds the complement of missile launchers, so the US  ships would have the edge in a one-on-one engagement\".\nHis guess, he says, \"in the absence of any hard evidence\", \"is that the Type 052D is on par with older US Aegis vessels. This is the big unknown, and I would encourage no one to make policy or strategy based on my guesswork!\"\nJames Holmes stresses that the modus operandi of the Chinese navy must also be taken into account when assessing the impact these new ships might have. The 052D may be an inferior vessel to its US counterparts, but it will not be operating alone.\n\"Let's keep in mind that China operates its fleet almost entirely within range of shore-based anti-ship missiles, fighter aircraft, and ships like patrol craft and submarines.\"\n\"These provide protective cover for the surface fleet and, Beijing believes (and I agree), that this is the great equaliser.\"\n\"Why go to the effort and expense of building a mirror image of the US Navy if you can hammer away from shore? In short, China doesn't need a fleet symmetrical to the US Navy to fight on ground of its own choosing, namely the China seas and Western Pacific.\"", "output": ["Over recent weeks China defence bloggers have been excited by the emergence of pictures of what appears to be a new class of guided missile destroyer for the Chinese Navy."]}, {"id": "task1290-c2ba4fe972d74b8cafd1739d89942690", "input": "Is there something you have seen or heard that you would like us to investigate?\nIt could be a burning issue or something you have always wondered about the area or its people.\nUse the tool below to send us your questions.\nWe could be in touch and your question could make the news.", "output": ["Have you got a question about Coventry & Warwickshire?", "Have you got a question about Stoke and Staffordshire?", "Have you got a question about Shropshire?", "Have you got a question about Hereford & Worcester?", "Have you got a question about Birmingham and the Black Country?"]}, {"id": "task1290-ad97d964e4a94e8dac3c4899af933027", "input": "Conservationists had called for the villa, a cultural heritage site, to be converted into a museum.\nBut officials said the decision to lease it to McDonald's was made because they needed to cover maintenance costs.\nMr Chiang's grandson and others have voiced their concern over the commercialisation of the site.\nMcDonald's opened the 100-seat McCafe in the lower storey of the villa, situated by the city's West Lake tourist attraction, over the weekend.\nThe upper storey, also leased out by officials, houses a Starbucks outlet which opened a month earlier.\nChiang Ching-Kuo is the son of revolutionary figure and Taiwanese leader Chiang Kai-shek, who fled to the island in 1949 after the Chinese Civil War.\nChiang Ching-Kuo later become the leader of Taiwan in 1978.\nChiang Ching-Kuo and his family stayed in the villa from October to November, 1948, and it was designated a cultural heritage site by Hangzhou officials in 2003.\nWhat's behind the China-Taiwan divide?\nThe move has been criticised by Chiang's grandson, Taiwanese businessman Demos Chiang, on microblogging platform Weibo.\n\"I don't understand, opening a McDonald's in the villa... how exactly does that adhere to regulations on correct usage of cultural heritage sites?\" he said in a post.\nIn 2000, Beijing saw a similar controversy when a Starbucks outlet opened in the Forbidden City.\nIt shut in 2007 after officials decided to merge and cut down the number of shops in the palace, following multiple protests over the years about the commercialisation of the site.\nBeijing Youth Daily reported that the decision to commercially lease out the villa was met with strong resistance, with more than 90% attendees at a public consultation in January voting against it.\nConservationists suggested that the villa be turned into a historical museum promoting China-Taiwan ties.\nOne of them, Zhejiang University academic Zhou Fuduo, noted that the villa was a symbol of China and Taiwan's shared history.\n\"We said that the villa's sociocultural value outstrips its commercial value, but in the end our proposal was ignored,\" he told the paper.\nBut officials pointed out that the local government needed money to recoup the cost of maintaining the building throughout the years.\nA spokesman for the Zhejiang local government, which oversees Hangzhou city, told the newspaper: \"Chiang Ching-kuo stayed in this home too briefly and what is left is just the main structure, the interiors look nothing like they used to when the Chiang family was here... there is not much point in turning it into a museum.\"", "output": ["The opening of a McDonald's outlet in the home of former Taiwanese leader Chiang Ching-kuo in Hangzhou, China has sparked a controversy."]}, {"id": "task1290-a43a18c1d8834de98bb6e6a079950f7d", "input": "The buggy update - which was delivered via a wireless transmission - is causing affected vehicles' infotainments systems to stop working.\nThis prevents drivers from getting navigation directions, climate controls and digital radio.\nThe Toyota division has acknowledged the problem and said owners needed to bring their cars in.\n\"Errant data broadcast by our traffic and weather data service provider was not handled as expected by the microcomputer in the vehicle navigation head unit (centre display) of 2014-16 Model Year Lexus vehicles and 2016 Model Year Toyota Land Cruiser,\" a spokeswoman explained.\n\"In some situations, this issue can cause the head unit to restart repeatedly, affecting operation of the navigation system (if equipped), audio and climate control features.

Gunners duo Hector Bellerin and Danny Welbeck had perfectly clear penalties turned down, and how anyone could argue Alexandre Lacazette's toe was offside is so tenuous it beggars belief.\nWhat's the game coming to? Is this what TV evidence was created for: to examine if a toe is in an offside position or not? What next - forelocks?\nWhat TV evidence did clearly portray was performance - and that's what it was designed to do. In that regard, Butland is slowly coming back to his best and, in my opinion, is currently England's number one choice.\nOf course, he will have to prove that by having an outstanding, injury-free season - but if he achieves that it will be great news for Stoke and even better news for England.\nNow this lad looks promising. It's been a long time since Liverpool have had a full-back with a left foot like Andrew Robertson.\nHis crosses, against a Crystal Palace side much better organised and purposeful than they were last week against Huddersfield, reminded me of Germany and Hamburg legend Manny Kaltz.\nAlthough Kaltz was a right-back, his quality of crossing was legendary and Robertson appears to have that ability. The young Scot also looks comfortable on the ball with an eye for goal - a feature clearly demonstrated when he forced Palace keeper Wayne Hennessey to tip the ball over the bar at full stretch.\nThe issue is, of course, can the full-back defend? Palace didn't really test him, but better teams will.\nRobertson is obviously part of Liverpool's future, unlike midfielder Philippe Coutinho. There is no doubt that Coutinho has already mentally left Anfield and the club would be foolish not to accept his position.\nHowever, what the Reds don't have to accept is any old Barcelona offer. They are perfectly entitled to squeeze every last penny out of this deal, and when they do finally settle on the transaction - and they will - I hope it makes Barcelona's eyes water.\nI want to like this player, but he always gives me the 'willies'.\nEric Bailly, on his day, is a class act - a point clearly demonstrated against Swansea - but why does he give me a sense of nervous apprehension every time he plays?\nI can't help feeling he's a tackle away from a red card or giving a penalty away. Against the likes of Swansea he will be fine, but it's in the big games, when it really matters, that I find myself asking the question: can he be trusted?\nThis was almost a complete performance from Harry Maguire against a Brighton team in desperate need of quality.\nI saw Maguire play for Hull against Chelsea last season at Stamford Bridge and he was outstanding. Since then, he has developed into a Premier League player and looks like making the transition from Hull to Leicester City quite comfortably.\nDuring that time he has won admiring comments from pundits like Martin Keown and Gary Lineker. Having worked with both, I can assure you that neither of my BBC colleagues are easily pleased, particularly when it comes to evaluating defenders, with the former an uncompromising centre-back and the latter an exceptional centre-forward. I get the feeling that both would have welcomed the no-nonsense Maguire in their teams.\nHowever, Brighton failed to put Maguire under any pressure whatsoever - a feature captured when the camera caught owner Tony Bloom with his head in his hands in frustration, having seen another one of his team's attacks come to nothing.\nThere is one simple solution to all this anguish, Mr Bloom: put your hand in your pocket and bring in the quality the club requires to survive in the best league in the world. Otherwise there will be far more moments like this.\nWhat an excellent choice of captain by United manager Jose Mourinho. Antonio Valencia proved to be an excellent player under former boss Sir Alex Ferguson and looks even more valuable to United in this season's title-chasing campaign under Mourinho.\nThe Ecuadorian can still deliver the first-time cross when in advanced areas - unlike most full-backs in the Premier League - and is as quick in recovery as any defender in the top flight.\nAgainst a totally outclassed Swansea, Valencia looked unflappable and reflects a calm demeanour not normally associated with a Mourinho side.\nThe Swans, meanwhile, hardly laid a glove on United (regardless of the score on 79 minutes) and with midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson gone to Everton, the measured manager Paul Clement needs to replace his best player with another talisman very quickly, otherwise his season could be over quicker than a verse of Land Of My Fathers.\nLast week it was striker Steve Mounie who stole the show. This Sunday against Newcastle - another promoted team short in quality - it was Aaron Mooy who ripped the heart out of the Magpies with a moment of sheer magic.\nI said last week, after the performance against Crystal Palace, that Huddersfield were going to have to call on players like Mooy and Mounie if they intend to stay in the league. His goal was of the highest quality, but more importantly the Australian possesses the tools to unlock any defence.\nMeanwhile, Newcastle have one of the best managers in the world who is having to suffer the indignation of an owner who cannot match his ambition. So can someone explain to me what's Rafael Benitez doing there?\nTo keep midfielder Ander Herrera out of the team tells its own story, but Henrikh Mkhitaryan is doing much more than that at the moment. The Armenia international complements this new-look Manchester United team perfectly.\nThis is a very uncomplicated footballer. He doesn't fuss when things don't go his own way and loves to get involved in the action.\nMkhitaryan was responsible for striker Romelu Lukaku and midfielder Paul Pogba's goals, which both came within a matter of minutes. It was also Mkhitaryan's performance that put the game well out of Swansea's reach.\nPogba's header from the corner was impressive during the 4-0 win over Swansea, but why on earth did defender Federico Fernandez not just clear the rebound from the underside of the bar instead of trying to protect his goalkeeper? Lukasz Fabianski didn't need protecting, he needed a clearance.\nTo be perfectly honest, it wouldn't have mattered anyway because, without Sigurdsson, the chances of Swansea winning this fixture were so remote it wasn't even worth a bet.\nRegardless, this was a Pogba performance worth noting. Apart from the ridiculous brown patch in his hair, he produced a game free of the showboating and scored a goal of real class. His yellow card was justified, but what took place thereafter was so measured and so utterly professional and selfless, it was in stark contrast to anything I had seen from the player before.\nI keep hearing pundits (mostly his mates) telling me Pogba is capable of almost anything. Well, I think we are finally starting to see it. It is about time.\nAll credit to Blues manager Antonio Conte for the way he reconstructed a side ravaged by injury and suspension to face Tottenham and beat them at Wembley. Premier League fixtures don't come much bigger than this and managers need players with a strong mentality and bags of courage.\nUp steps Marcos Alonso. The wing-back could have easily ducked the moment and let Willian - also a dead-ball specialist - take the free-kick. But he didn't, he took control of the situation and buried it. The Spaniard didn't stop there either - his overall contribution to this Chelsea performance was immense. How this lad hasn't yet emulated his father and grandfather and represented Spain is a mystery to me.\nThis victory will also solidify Conte's managerial position. Make no mistake, the Italian has not handled the Diego Costa situation well and his top scorer last season will be very hard to replace. But the way the Chelsea players have rallied behind their boss to win such an important game speaks volumes about the manager and his players.\nWest Ham's day fell apart when, after missing two glorious chances, midfielder Marko Arnautovic threw an elbow into the head of Southampton's Jack Stephens.\nHis sending off was totally justified and Hammers boss Slaven Bilic is now under the sort of pressure he brought Arnautovic in to alleviate after just two games.\nThank goodness Bilic has invested in the services of someone who is considerably more reliable and far less combustible. Javier Hernandez scored two goals of the type that has become his hallmark during his career.\nI have no doubt the Hammers are going to be all right this season, but I'm less sure about Bilic's future after their mauling at Old Trafford last week and now this spirited defeat with 10 men at St Mary's.\nHowever, if Bilic can hold on until striker Andy Carroll is fit, he could have a really exciting forward line, with the Englishman, Hernandez and a slightly reformed Arnautovic as a front three.\nOnce Neymar arrived at Paris-St Germain, Jese Rodriguez was out of that club like a shot.\nStoke fans had every right to be stunned by the arrival of the former Real Madrid forward. Not since the arrival of Switzerland winger Xherdan Shaqiri have Stoke fans seen such a high-profile player land on their doorstep practically unannounced.\nIt clearly suited Jese to come to the Potteries - it is Premier League football after all, and not even Neymar is getting that.\nManager Mark Hughes is almost beside himself having landed the player and couldn't resist putting the Spaniard straight into the team to face Arsenal after only a few days of training with the squad. What a stroke of good management.\nJese needs somewhere to play, not to mention an environment where he will be loved.

It's about stereotypes and privileges that will take time to break down.\"\nFigures from Statistics Sweden confirm that women still take more than 80% of a couple's parental leave while their first child is under the age of two.\nWomen also remain much more likely to work part-time than men. When it comes to equal pay for similar work, Sweden is close to the OECD average and drops to 35th place on the World Economic Forum's gender equality ranking.\nIt isn't difficult to find Swedes who are willing to talk about the discrepancies.\n\"There's still a lot of fathers who don't take their parental leave so it's not perfect yet,\" says Martin Hector, 32, as he takes his baby son for a stroll in Ralambshovs park in central Stockholm.\n\"Over the summer, for three months or something like that, feels the most common.\"\nHe's planning to take a total of nine months off work.\nCamilla Dath, a lawyer who is also braving unusually chilly May temperatures of 2C with her seven-month-old, is taking 11 months' leave and says her husband will take a similar period off work.\nBut other parents might not have the same opportunities, she argues, if one partner earns substantially more than the other or because they work in organisations with more old-fashioned  cultures.\n\"I have friends working in big law firms and they have a harder time to take parental leave,\" she says.\nWhen it comes to the number of women in management, the biggest discrepancies are still in  the traditionally \"male\" industries of manufacturing and technology.\nHowever, Allbright's research suggests that financial services and property companies have made \"significant\" improvements in recent years.\nRental accommodation firm Heba, for example, recently climbed 100 places in Allbright's rankings after replacing several of its top male executives, resulting in a female majority in management.\nHowever its chief executive, Lennart Karlsson, is candid enough to admit that reaching gender equality was not his original goal.\n\"I thought competence was the main thing - competence and attitude - not sex, but I've changed my mind. The workplace works better because of the [gender] mix,\" he says.\n\"The discussion climate is better, you have a better conversation and a better understanding for each other.\"\nAmanda Lundetag argues this should boost his business too, citing several recent studies including a high-profile report for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which concluded that there is a positive correlation between the presence of women in leadership roles and an organisation's performance.\nIt's a link that is definitely not lost on the Swedish politicians spearheading what they've described as \"the first feminist government in the world\".\nThe Nordic nation's Left-Green coalition pushed through a new law in 2015, aimed to encourage men to take a greater share of the parental leave. Ninety days are now reserved for fathers on a \"use it or lose\" it basis.\n\"What we want to see is an equal participation from the parents in the long run... but we also have to take it slowly so that families will be able to adapt to the changes,\" says Annika Strandhall, Sweden's Minister for Social Security.\nNext year will even see the launch of a new Gender Equality Authority, an admission, according to Ms Strandhall, that Sweden's world-famous feminist initiatives have not been as joined-up as they might have been.\nYet while creating equal opportunities for men and women appears largely hard-wired into the national psyche, Sweden is split on the extent to which the state should intervene to pick up the pace.\nThe government's attempt to introduce legislation that would fine listed companies which fail to appoint women to at least 40% of board seats was rejected by parliament in January.\nThe fear of potential penalties seems to have acted as a catalyst, though; 33% of those put forward for board seats so far in 2017 are women, up 2% on last year, says Allbright, putting Sweden behind only Norway and France, both of which have legally-binding quotas.\nHowever, the nationalist Sweden Democrats (currently the second-most popular party in the polls) and the smaller centre-right Christian Democrats -voted against the 90-day parental leave quota for fathers. They want families to have a greater choice when it comes to organising parenting.\n\"There is a societal pressure...  because everyone goes back to work. I felt I would be going against the norm if I had stayed at home,\" explains Simone French, a 46-year-old who is originally from Australia.\nShe says she would have welcomed the opportunity to stay at home until her son started school. Instead she ended up taking just a year off from her digital marketing career amid pressure from her employer and relatives.\n\"It was my maternal instinct to be with my son - every fibre in my being fought against going back. It's not really talked about here but I have actually met a couple of Swedish women who felt the same.\"\nHowever those cheerleading Sweden's march towards a completely gender equal society argue that evening out parental responsibilities is as much about giving fathers the same chance to bond with their children while they are young, as it is giving women greater opportunities to climb the ladder back in the workplace.\n\"You become closer with the children - a better connection,\" says Andreas Lundvick, 38, one of the other fathers back in Ralambshovs park.\nHe's taking time out from his job at a major Swedish bank to look after his six-month-old son while his wife is studying full-time, a move he believes will have \"no impact\" on his future career.\n\"I feel lucky, when you speak to people from other countries, and you hear about their situation, it's mostly the mum being home with the children.

His chances of winning the White House are diminishing. His campaign is in disarray, he himself is sounding increasingly apocalyptic.\nSo let's try instead to examine some of those more awkward abuse questions, because they reveal something rotten in our society.\nA lot of women, especially women just starting their careers, encounter men who do or say things that are sexually inappropriate.\nIt's worth noting that Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Dominique Strauss Kahn (to name a few) have been the subjects of multiple allegations, whilst no one has ever accused Barack Obama, George Bush or Ronald Reagan of groping.\nMost men would never dream of doing such things, but women quickly learn who not to get stuck with in an empty office.\nMen in powerful posts are particularly dangerous because the higher you get, the less people say no to you. That's true everywhere - in business, in politics, in the military, in the civil service, even in journalism.\nRachel Crooks says she was 22 when Trump kissed her without consent.

The women knew that if they said they'd been raped, they'd never be able to return home.\nThe United States is not Nigeria, but even here women who talk about sexual abuse are often called liars or shamed publicly.\nMr Trump has done just that today - calling the accusers \"horrible people\" and implying the People Magazine journalist wasn't attractive enough for him to harass.\nHe seems furious that anyone would say he put his hand up a stranger's skirt on the plane, or forced his tongue into someone's mouth - calling the Times reporter who wrote the story \"a disgusting human being\".\nBut how is it different from the activity he described on that Access Hollywood tape?\nAbuse happens in private, so it's inevitably a case of she said/he said.\nBut we do know abuse is a lot more common than people like to think.

Women who have been assaulted are often asked, why didn't you just say no?\nBut that's just a way of blaming the victim and transferring the guilt from the abuser to the abused. The only shame here belongs to the men.\nIt looks like we are going to spend the final three weeks of the US presidential election scraping round in the sordid gutter of sexual misbehaviour.

He also claims that he will be the best candidate for women.\nBut how, in 2016, does that square with having such an old-fashioned view of parenting duties?\nOne of the biggest things holding professional women back from participating full-time in the workforce is not having husbands who are prepared to share 50% of all child-rearing chores.\nIt is really hard for a woman to put in the time needed to succeed at work if her husband won't pitch in fully at home.

But this regressive gender stereotyping is less appealing to women.\nAccording to a March NBC/WSJ poll 47% of female Republican primary voters cannot see themselves voting for Trump while only 32% say the same about Ted Cruz.\nAnd Mr Trump consistently has a 20-odd point gap in support between men and women.

Punishing the woman has never been the position of even the most ardent anti-abortionists here.\nSticking to that original town hall statement would have made it very difficult for Mr Trump to close his gap with women voters.\nSince single, suburban women will probably decide the outcome of this election, that is something Mr Trump has to do to become president.", "output": ["Donald Trump said women who have abortions should be punished, he made crude insinuations about a TV anchor's menstrual cycle and he doesn't change nappies or do bedtimes."]}, {"id": "task1290-882f2350c6574a9ca8c2c1f636d44e9d", "input": "Bernadette Smyth, who leads the anti-abortion group Precious Life, was replying to a prosecution lawyer.\nMrs Smyth, of Suffolk Street, Ballymena, County Antrim, denies harassing Marie Stopes clinic director Dawn Purvis.\nThe lawyer suggested she had laughed at Ms Purvis in a \"cackling, jeering, mocking way, in a witch's manner.\"\nMs Smyth replied: \"I can't agree with this court that I'm a witch.

\"I'm voting Labour to protect our NHS\".\nThe problem is that powers over health are devolved to the Welsh Assembly, which has a Labour majority.\nAnd that means that whoever wins the general election next month will not be able to do a lot about the NHS in Wales.\nTo be fair, the voter in question may be concerned about the NHS in England, which is still controlled by the Westminster Parliament.\nIt could be a poster left over from the 2011 Welsh Assembly elections or indeed it could be an early pitch for the 2016 elections.\nThe point is that it highlights the complexity around devolved powers.\nThe only way that your Member of Parliament in Westminster can influence health policy in Wales, and indeed Scotland and Northern Ireland, is via the Barnett formula.\nThe amount each nation receives in funding is decided by applying that formula to the amount spent in England.\nBut even if the UK government decided to spend less on health, the devolved governments could maintain or increase their own spending on health if they reallocated money from other parts of their budgets.\nEducation is also devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as is the provision of childcare.\nBut when it becomes a taxation issue, for example, giving tax relief on money spent on childcare, it becomes a UK-wide issue.\nCrime and policing policy are devolved to Scotland and Northern Ireland, but not Wales.\nMeanwhile the Home Office is responsible for UK borders and immigration as well as policy on serious and organised crime.\nYou can find a more comprehensive list of devolved powers in this article on the BBC News website.\nMany of the devolved powers have been in place since the late 1990s, but there are a few devolution issues that have been peculiar to this campaign.\nThe first has been the inclusion of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood in the UK-wide televised leaders' debates.\nHowever much viewers in the rest of the UK might have been impressed by those two leaders, they are unable to vote for either of those parties as Plaid Cymru and the SNP are only putting up candidates in their home countries.\nThe other point is that Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats are all in favour of devolving more powers to the Scottish Parliament.\nThat is on top of the powers from the Scotland Act 2012, which do not fully come into force until next year.\nSo for voters in Scotland, during the next Parliament your Westminster MP will in fact have less power over issues that affect you than during the previous Parliament.\nWhat is the truth behind the politicians' claims on the campaign trail?

Deignan outsprinted Italy's Elisa Longo Borghini to claim second.\nFroome might have extended his overnight lead from 23 to 54 seconds, but there was an almighty battle for the other two podium spots.\nFrench favourite Romain Bardet trailed Froome by 23 seconds overnight while Colombian Rigoberto Uran was 29 seconds behind the leader.\nBut Froome's Sky team-mate Mikel Landa had been in superb form during the Tour and, starting the time trial one minute 36 seconds behind the leader, went down the ramp knowing that a strong ride could see him claw his way into the top three.\nUran got a corner wrong as he prepared to enter the Stade de Velodrome at the end of his ride and Bardet paid after attacking too hard on the climb up to Notre Dame de la Grande.\nIn the end, Bardet slipped to third, losing second place to Uran, and clung onto a podium spot by the tightest of margins - finishing one second ahead of the unfortunate Landa.\nTV pictures showed Bardet looking shattered and distraught after his ride but at least he held onto third.\n\"I really didn't feel good,\" said Bardet.\n\"For the last few days I haven't been in good health and today I paid for it in cash.

That meant he had extended his lead over key general classification rivals Bardet and Uran, and it was obvious that barring an unforeseen problem victory would be his.\nThe only question would be whether he went on to win the stage - something that had eluded him in the race so far.\nBut he could not match the time of Bora-Hansgrohe rider Bodnar, who in the end finished one second ahead of Kwiatkowski to claim the most famous stage win of his career.\nBodnar, who had been 52nd of the 167 remaining competitors down the ramp, had been caught 200m from the line in Pau at the end of stage 11 after a solo breakaway of 200km.\nAnd so barring an extremely unlikely stage win in Paris, Froome will become the seventh man to win a Tour without a stage victory.\nMost of the other jerseys had been long wrapped up before the start of Saturday's stage.\nWe knew that Australian Michael Matthews would roll into Paris wearing green as the race's top sprinter and Frenchman Warren Barguil in the polka dot jersey as the King of the Mountains.\nBut Britain's Simon Yates was seventh - just one place ahead of South African Louis Meintjes in the white jersey competition for the best rider under the age of 26.\nThe gap between them was two minutes six seconds overnight - and that was exactly how it finished at the end of Saturday's stage.\nBack in Dusseldorf on 1 July, 198 riders from 22 teams set off on the long road to Paris.\nAfter 3,521km it is almost time for the 167 remaining riders to end their Tour with Sunday's 103km procession from Montgeron to Paris.\nThe 21st and final stage of the race starts at 15:40 BST and is scheduled to finish at approximately 18:30 BST.\nRacing will only really start for real when the riders get to Paris - and the remaining sprinters in the contest battle it out for one final stage win.\nStage 20 result:\n1.
