There are two possible referents for \"they\", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb \"told\" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form \"X told Y that (X or Y) did something.\"\nLet's consider Y first: \"X told Y that Y did something.\" This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.\nNow, consider X: \"X told Y that X did something.\" This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.\nBecause in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A)."}, {"input": "In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.\nSentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.\nOptions:\n(A) The secretary didn't reply yet\n(B) The manager didn't reply yet\n(C) Ambiguous", "output": "Let's think step by step.\nHere we need to determine who the pronoun \"he\" might be referring to.

The sentence is then of the form \"X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet.\"\nLet's consider Y first: \"X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet.\" This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.\nNow, consider X: \"X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet.\" This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.\nBecause in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A)."}, {"input": "In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.\nSentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office\nOptions:\n(A) It will be Bailey's office\n(B) It will be the director's office\n(C) Ambiguous", "output": "Let's think step by step.\nHere we need to determine who the pronoun \"his\" might be referring to.
