This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words \"white\" and \"snake\".\n(A) \"whitesnape\": It is formed by the combination of \"white\" and \"snake\"; therefore, \"snake\" has been changed to \"snape\". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.\n(B) \"whitesnapke\": It is formed by the combination of \"white\" and \"snapke\", but \"snapke\" is not an actual word; therefore, \"whitesnapke\" is not humorous.\n(C) \"whitesnuake\": It is formed by the combination of \"white\" and \"snuake\", but \"snuake\" is not an actual word; therefore, \"whitesnuake\" is not humorous.\n(D) \"mwhitesnake\": It is formed by the combination of \"m\", \"white\", and \"snake\", but the prefix \"-m \"seems arbitrary; therefore, \"mwhitesnake\" is not meaningful or humorous.\nAbove the above, the only humorous edit is (A).

This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.\n(D) \"one of our dinosaur is missing\": Here the word \"dinosaurs\" is changed to \"dinosaur\", but \"dinosaur\" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.\nAbove the above, the only humorous edit is (C).\nAbove the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
